We define connections on higher inductive types. We then define tangent bundles and vector fields by looking at the special subclass of combinatorial manifolds, which are discrete in the sense of real cohesion (Shulman, 2017), drawing inspiration from the field of discrete differential geometry. We prove the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and Poincaré-Hopf theorem for combinatorial manifolds.\n“It is always ourselves we work on, whether we realize it or not. There is no other work to be done in the world.” — Stephen Talbott, The Future Does Not Compute (Talbott, 1995)\n1 Overview We will define\ncombinatorial 2-manifolds\ncircle bundles, and principal circle bundles of tangent bundles\nvector fields,\nand then observe emerging from those definitions the presence of\nconnections\ncurvature\nthe index of a vector field,\nand prove\nthe Gauss-Bonnet theorem\nand the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\nWe will consider functions \\(M\\to \\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) where \\(\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) is the connected component in the universe of the Eilenberg-MacLane space \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) which we will take to be \\(S^1\\), and where \\(M\\) is a combinatorial manifold of dimension 2, which is a simplicial complex encoded in a higher inductive type, such that each vertex has a neighborhood that looks like a disk with a discrete circle boundary (i.e. a polygon). We can call terms \\(C:\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) “mere circles.”\nWe will see in Section 3.3 that \\(\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) contains all the polygons. We will construct a map \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{\\mathsf{link}}}:M\\to\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) that maps each vertex to the polygon consisting of its neighbors. Then we can consider the type of pointed mere circles \\(\\mathrm{EM_{\\bullet}}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\sum_{Y:\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)}Y\\) as well as the first projection that forgets the point. This is a univalent fibration (univalent fibrations are always equivalent to a projection of a type of pointed types to some connected component of the universe (Christensen, 2015)). If we form the pullback\nthen we have a bundle of mere circles, with total space given by the \\(\\sum_{}\\)-type construction. We will show that this is not a principal bundle, i.e. a bundle of torsors. Torsors are types with the additional structure of a group action. But if \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{\\mathsf{link}}}\\) satisfies an additional property (amounting to an orientation) then the pullback is a principal fibration, i.e. \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{\\mathsf{link}}}\\) factors through a map \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},2)\\to\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\), where \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},2)\\) is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space.\nWe will argue that extending \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{\\mathsf{link}}}\\) to a function \\(T\\) on paths can be thought of as constructing a connection, notably one that is not necessarily flat (trivial). Moreover, lifting \\(T\\) to \\(T_\\bullet:M\\to\\mathrm{EM_{\\bullet}}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) can be thought of as a nonvanishing vector field. There will in general not be a total lift, just a partial function. The domain of \\(T_\\bullet\\) will have a boundary of circles, and the degree (winding number) on the disjoint union of these can be thought of as the index of \\(T_\\bullet\\). We can then examine the total curvature and the total index and prove that they are equal, and argue that they are equal to the usual Euler characteristic. This will simultaneously prove the Poincaré-Hopf theorem and Gauss-Bonnet theorem in 2 dimensions, for combinatorial manifolds. This is similar to the classical proof of Hopf (Hopf, 1983), presented in detail in Needham (Needham, 2021).\n1.1 Future work The results of this note can be extended in many directions. There are higher-dimensional generalizations of Gauss-Bonnet, including the theory of characteristic classes and Chern-Weil theory (which links characteristic classes to connections and curvature). These would involve working with nonabelian groups like \\(SO(n)\\) and sphere bundles. Results from gauge theory could be imported into HoTT, as well as results from surgery theory and other topological constructions that may be especially amenable to this discrete setting. Relationships with computer graphics and discrete differential geometry (Crane et al., 2013) (Crane, 2010) could be explored. Finally, a theory that reintroduces smoothness could allow more formal versions of the analogies explored here.\n2 Torsors and principal bundles The classical theory of principal bundles tells us to look for an appropriate classifying space of torsors to map into.\nDefinition 1. Let \\(G\\) be a group with identity element \\(e\\) (with the usual classical structure and properties). A \\(G\\)-set is a set \\(X\\) equipped with a homomorphism \\(\\phi:(G,e)\\to\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}(X)\\). If in addition we have a term \\[\\mathsf{is\\_torsor}:||X||_{-1}\\times \\prod_{x:X}\\mathsf{is\\_equiv}(\\phi(-,x):(G,e)\\to (X,x))\\] then we call this data a \\(G\\)-torsor. Denote the type of \\(G\\)-torsors by \\(BG\\).\nIf \\((X,\\phi),(Y,\\psi):BG\\) then a \\(G\\)-equivariant map is a function \\(f:X\\to Y\\) such that \\(f(\\phi(g,x))=\\psi(g,f(x))\\). Denote the type of \\(G\\)-equivariant maps by \\(X\\to_G Y\\).\nLemma 1. There is a natural equivalence \\((X=_{BG}Y) \\simeq (X\\to_G Y)\\).\u0007\nDenote by \\(*\\) the torsor given by \\(G\\) actions on its underlying set by left-translation. This serves as a basepoint for \\(BG\\) and we have a group isomorphism \\(\\Omega BG\\simeq G\\).\nLemma 2. A \\(G\\)-set \\((X,\\phi)\\) is a \\(G\\)-torsor if and only if there merely exists a \\(G\\)-equivariant equivalence \\(*\\to_G X\\).\u0007\nCorollary 1. The pointed type \\((BG,*)\\) is a \\(\\mathrm{K}(G,1)\\).\u0007\nIn particular, to classify principal \\(S^1\\)-bundles we map into the space \\(\\mathrm{K}(S^1, 1)\\), a type of torsors of the circle. Since \\(S^1\\) is a \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{K}(S^1,1)\\simeq\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},2)\\).\n2.1 Bundles of mere circles We find it illuminating to look also at the slightly more general classifying space of \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\)-bundles, that is bundles whose fiber are equivalent to \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\). We can understand very well when these are in fact bundles of circle torsors, which will in turn shed light on orientation in this setting.\nWe will follow Scoccola (Scoccola, 2020). We will state the definitions and theorems for a general \\(\\mathrm{K}(G,n)\\) but we will be focusing on \\(n=1\\) in this note.\nDefinition 2. Let \\(\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\mathop{\\mathrm{BAut}}(\\mathrm{K}(G,n))\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\sum_{Y:\\mathcal{U}}||Y\\simeq \\mathrm{K}(G,n)||_{-1}\\). A \\(\\mathrm{K}(G,n)\\)-bundle on a type \\(M\\) is the fiber of a map \\(M\\to\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\).\nScoccola uses two self-maps on the universe: suspension followed by \\((n+1)\\)-truncation \\(||\\Sigma||_{n+1}\\) and forgetting a point \\(F_\\bullet\\) to form the composition \\[\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\xrightarrow[]{||\\Sigma||_{n+1}} \\mathrm{EM}_{\\bullet\\bullet}(G,n+1)\\xrightarrow[]{F_\\bullet}\\mathrm{EM_{\\bullet}}(G,n+1)\\] from types to types with two points (north and south), to pointed types (by forgetting the south point).\nDefinition 3. Given \\(f:M\\to\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\), the associated action of \\(M\\) on \\(G\\), denoted by \\(f_\\bullet\\) is defined to be \\(f_\\bullet=F_\\bullet\\circ||\\Sigma||_{n+1}\\circ f\\).\nTheorem 1. (Scoccola (Scoccola, 2020) Proposition 2.39). A \\(\\mathrm{K}(G,n)\\) bundle \\(f:M\\to\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\) is equivalent to a map in \\(M\\to\\mathrm{K}(G,n+1)\\), and so is a principal fibration, if and only if the associated action \\(f_\\bullet\\) is contractible.\nLet’s relate this to orientation. Note that the obstruction in the theorem is about a map into \\(\\mathrm{EM_{\\bullet}}(G,n+1)\\) and further note that \\(\\mathrm{EM_{\\bullet}}(G,n)\\simeq \\mathrm{K}(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}G,1)\\) (independent of \\(n\\)). The theorem says that the data of a map into \\(\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\) factors into data about a map into \\(\\mathrm{K}(G,n+1)\\) and one into \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}G,1)\\). Informally, \\(\\mathrm{EM}(G,n)\\) is a little too large to be a \\(K(G,n+1)\\), as it includes data about automorphisms of \\(G\\).\nIn the special case of \\(\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) the conditions of the theorem are met when \\(f_\\bullet:M\\to\\mathrm{K}(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}, 1)\\) is contractible. \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}\\) consists of the \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}/2\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}\\) worth of outer automorphisms given by multiplication by \\(\\pm 1\\). If we look at the fiber sequence \\[\\mathrm{K}(S^1, 1)\\to \\mathop{\\mathrm{BAut}}S^1\\to \\mathrm{K}(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}, 1)\\] we see the automorphisms of the circle as an extension of the group of automorphisms that are homotopic to the identity (which are the torsorial actions) by the group that sends the loop in \\(S^1\\) to its inverse. This is another way to see that a map \\(f:M\\to \\mathop{\\mathrm{BAut}}S^1\\simeq \\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) factors through \\(\\mathrm{K}(S^1, 1)\\simeq \\mathrm{K}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},2)\\) if and only if the composition to \\(\\mathrm{K}(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) is trivial. This amounts to a choice of loop-direction for all the circles, and so deserves the name “\\(f\\) is oriented.” In addition the map \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{BAut}}S^1\\to \\mathrm{K}(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}, 1)\\) deserves to be called the first Stiefel-Whitney class of \\(f\\), and the requirement here is that it vanishes.\nNote 1. Reinterpreting more of the theory of characteristic classes would be an enlightening future project. Defining a Chern class and Euler class in 2 dimensions is related to the goals of this note, but the full theory is about a family of invariants in different dimensions that have various relations between each other and satisfy other properties.\n2.2 Pathovers in circle bundles Suppose we have \\(T:M\\to\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\) and \\(P\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\sum_{x:M}T(x)\\). We adopt a convention of naming objects in \\(M\\) with Latin letters, and the corresponding structures in \\(P\\) with Greek letters. Recall that if \\(p:a=_M b\\) then \\(T\\) acts on \\(p\\) with what’s called the action on paths, denoted \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{ap}}(T)(p):T(a)=T(b)\\). This is a path in the codomain, which in this case is a type of types. Type theory also provides a function called transport, denoted \\(\\mathsf{tr}(p):T(a)\\to T(b)\\) which acts on the fibers of \\(P\\). \\(\\mathsf{tr}(p)\\) is a function, acting on the terms of the types \\(T(a)\\) and \\(T(b)\\), and univalence tells us this is the isomorphism corresponding to \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{ap}}(T)(p)\\).\nType theory also tells us that paths in \\(P\\) are given by pairs of paths: a path \\(p:a=_M b\\) in the base, and a pathover \\(\\pi:\\mathsf{tr}(p)(\\alpha)=_{T(b)}\\beta\\) between \\(\\alpha:T(a)\\) and \\(\\beta:T(b)\\) in the fibers. We can’t directly compare \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) since they are of different types, so we apply transport to one of them. We say \\(\\pi\\) lies over \\(p\\). See Figure 1.\nA path \\(\\pi\\) over the path \\(p\\) in the base involves the transport function. Lastly we want to recall that in the presence of a section \\(X:M\\to P\\) there is a dependent generalization of \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{ap}}\\) called \\(\\mathsf{apd}\\): \\(\\mathsf{apd}(X)(p):\\mathsf{tr}(p)(X(a))=X(b)\\) which is a pathover between the two values of the section over the basepoints of the path \\(p\\).\n3 Combinatorial manifolds 3.1 Combinatorial manifolds We will adapt to higher inductive types in a straightforward manner the classical construction of combinatorial manifolds. See for example the classic book by Kirby and Siebenmann (Kirby \u0026amp; Siebenmann, 1977). These are a subclass of simplicial complexes.\nDefinition 4. An abstract simplicial complex \\(M\\) of dimension \\(n\\) consists of a set \\(M_0\\) of vertices, and for each \\(0\u0026lt;k\\leq n\\) a set \\(M_k\\) of subsets of \\(M_0\\) of cardinality \\(k+1\\), such that any \\((j+1)\\)-element subset of \\(M_k\\) is an element of \\(M_j\\). The elements of \\(M_k\\) are called \\(k\\)-faces. Denote by \\(\\mathsf{SimpCompSet_n}\\) the type of abstract simplicial complexes of dimension \\(n\\) (where the suffix \\(\\mathsf{Set}\\) reminds us that this is a type of sets).\nNote that we don’t require all subsets of \\(M_0\\) to be included – that would make \\(M\\) an individual simplex. A simplicial complex is a family of simplices that are identified along various faces.\nDefinition 5. In an abstract simplicial complex \\(M\\) of dimension \\(n\\), the link of a vertex \\(v\\) is the \\(n-1\\)-face containing every face \\(m\\in M_{n-1}\\) such that \\(v\\notin m\\) and \\(m\\cup v\\) is an \\(n\\)-face of \\(M\\).\nThe link is all the neighboring vertices of \\(v\\) and the codimension 1 faces joining those to each other. See for example Figure 2.\nThe link of \\(v\\) in this complex consists of the vertices \\(\\{a,b,c,d,e,f\\}\\) and the edges \\(\\{ab,bc,cd,de,ef,fa\\}\\), forming a hexagon. Definition 6. A combinatorial manifold (or combinatorial triangulation) of dimension \\(n\\) is a simplicial complex of dimension \\(n\\) such that the link of every vertex is a simplicial sphere of dimension \\(n-1\\) (i.e. its geometric realization is homeomorphic to an \\(n-1\\)-sphere). Denote by \\(\\mathsf{CombMfdSet_n}\\) the type of combinatorial manifolds of dimension \\(n\\) (which the notation again reminds us are sets).\nIn a 2-dimensional combinatorial manifold the link is a polygon. See Figures 3, 4, and 5 for some examples of 2-dimensional combinatorial manifolds of genus 0, 1, and 3.\nA classical 1940 result of Whitehead, building on Cairn, states that every smooth manifold admits a combinatorial triangulation (Whitehead, 1940). So it appears reasonably well motivated to study this class of objects.\nA combinatorial triangulation of a sphere, created with the tool stripy. A torus with an interesting triangulation, from Wikipedia. The links have various vertex counts from 5-7. Clearly a constant value of 6 would also work. (By Ag2gaeh - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0.) A 3-holed torus with triangulation, from Wikipedia. (By Ag2gaeh - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0.) 3.2 Higher inductive combinatorial manifolds We will convert a simplicial complex \\(M\\) of dimension at most 2 to a higher inductive type, in two steps.\nDefinition 7. Define \\(\\mathsf{CombMfd_2}\\) to be the type of higher inductive constructors of combinatorial manifolds of dimension at most 2 and let \\(\\mathcal{H}:\\mathsf{CombMfdSet_2}\\to\\mathsf{CombMfd_2}\\) be a map from a combinatorial manifold to such a HIT following this method:\nvertices: a function \\(\\mathsf{v_0}:M_0\\to \\mathcal{H}(M)\\) serving as the 0-dimensional constructors\nedges: a function \\(\\mathsf{v_1}\\) on 1-faces, sending \\(\\{a, b\\}\\mapsto \\mathsf{v_0}(a)=\\mathsf{v_0}(b)\\)\n2-faces: a function \\(\\mathsf{v_2}\\) on 2-faces, sending \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\mapsto \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a = \\mathsf{v_1}(\\{a, b\\})\\cdot \\mathsf{v_1}(\\{b, c\\})\\cdot \\mathsf{v_1}(\\{a, c\\})^{-1}\\).\nWe will assume there is a formal theory of such HITs, and that at least up to dimension 2 there are no obstructions to simply copying over the combinatorial data to the HIT constructors. For recent work on HITs see for example David Wärn’s discussion of pushouts (Wärn, 2024).\nDefinition 8. Denote by \\(\\mathcal{R}:\\mathsf{CombMfd_2}\\to\\mathsf{Type}\\) the process of generating a type from the HIT data (which we refer to as realization). Note that \\(\\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{H}(M))\\) is not in general a set, and may not even be 2-truncated for an arbitrary 2-dimensional combinatorial manifold \\(M:\\mathsf{CombMfdSet_2}\\).\nWe’re making the distinction between \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) because we will mostly study functions and phenomena on \\(\\mathcal{H}(M)\\) for some simplicial complex \\(M\\).\n3.3 Polygons We will now start looking at some examples, first by defining a type that is important both for the domain and the codomain of mere circles: a square.\nDefinition 9. The higher inductive type \\(C_4\\) (where C stands for “circle”). See Figure 6. \\[\\begin{aligned} C_4 \u0026amp;: \\mathsf{Type}\\\\ c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \u0026amp;: C_4 \\\\ c_1c_2 \u0026amp;: c_1 = c_2 \\\\ c_2c_3 \u0026amp;: c_2 = c_3 \\\\ c_3c_4 \u0026amp;: c_3 = c_4 \\\\ c_4c_1 \u0026amp;: c_4 = c_1 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]\nThe HIT \\(C_4\\). The standard HoTT circle itself is a non-example of a combinatorial manifold since it lacks the second vertex of the edge:\nDefinition 10. The higher inductive type \\(S^1\\) which we can also call \\(C_1\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} S^1\u0026amp;:\\mathsf{Type}\\\\ \\mathsf{base}\u0026amp;:S^1\\\\ \\mathsf{loop}\u0026amp;:\\mathsf{base}=\\mathsf{base} \\end{aligned}\\]\nBoth of these are examples of a type we will call \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{Gon}}\\), the type of \\(n\\)-gons for some natural number \\(n\\), following the pattern of the HITs above. We’ll see below that \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{Gon}}\\) is a subtype of \\(\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\).\n3.4 New in 2025: Adding and removing points from polygons Given functions \\(\\phi,\\psi:A\\to B\\) between two arbitrary types we can form the type family of paths \\(\\alpha:A\\to\\mathcal{U}, \\alpha(a)\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}(\\phi(a)=_B\\psi(a))\\). Transport in this family is given by concatenation as follows, where \\(p:a=_A a\u0026#39;\\) and \\(q:\\phi(a)=\\psi(a)\\) (see Figure 7): \\[\\mathsf{tr}(p)(q) = \\phi(p)^{-1}\\cdot q\\cdot \\psi(p)\\] which gives a path in \\(\\phi(a\u0026#39;)=\\psi(a\u0026#39;)\\) by connecting dots between the terms \\(\\phi(a\u0026#39;), \\phi(a), \\psi(a), \\psi(a\u0026#39;)\\). This relates a would-be homotopy \\(\\phi\\sim\\psi\\) specified at a single point, to a point at the end of a path. We will use this to help construct such homotopies.\nTransport along \\(p\\) in the fibers of a family of paths. The fiber over \\(a\\) is \\(\\phi(a)=\\psi(a)\\) where \\(\\phi,\\psi:A\\to B\\). Lemma 3. Let \\(C_n\\) be the polygon 1-dimensional HIT with \\(n\\) vertices. Then \\(C_2\\simeq C_1\\) and in fact \\(C_n\\simeq C_{n-1}\\).\nProof. (Compare to (Univalent Foundations Program, 2013) Lemma 6.5.1.) In the case of \\(C_1\\) we will denote its constructors by \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{base}}\\) and \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{loop}}\\). For \\(C_2\\) we will denote the points by \\(v_1, v_2\\) and the edges by \\(\\ell_{12}, r_{21}\\). For \\(C_3\\) and higher we will denote the points by \\(v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\) and the edges by \\(e_{i,j}:v_i=v_j\\) where \\(j=i+1\\) except for \\(e_{n,1}\\).\nFirst we will define \\(f:C_2\\to C_1\\) and \\(g:C_1\\to C_2\\), then prove they are inverses. \\[\\begin{aligned} f(v_1)=f(v_2)\u0026amp;=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{base}}\u0026amp;\\quad g(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{base}})\u0026amp;=v_1\\\\ f(\\ell_{12})\u0026amp;=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{loop}}\u0026amp;\\quad g(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{loop}})\u0026amp;=\\ell_{12}\\cdot r_{21}\\\\ f(r_{21}) \u0026amp;= \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{base}}}\u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]\nWe need to show that \\(f\\circ g\\sim \\ensuremath{\\text{id}}_{C_1}\\) and \\(g\\circ f\\sim\\ensuremath{\\text{id}}_{C_2}\\). Think of \\(f\\) as sliding \\(v_2\\) along \\(r_{21}\\) to coalesce with \\(v_1\\). This may help understand why the unfortunately intricate proof is working.\nWe need terms \\(p:\\prod_{a:C_1}f(g(a))=a\\) and \\(q:\\prod_{a:C_2}g(f(a))=a\\). We will proceed by induction, defining appropriate paths on point constructors and then checking a condition on path constructors that confirms that the built-in transport of these type families respects the definition on points.\nLooking first at \\(g\\circ f\\), which shrinks \\(r_{21}\\), we have the following data to work with: \\[\\begin{aligned} g(f(v_1))=g(f(v_2))\u0026amp;=v_1\\\\ g(f(\\ell_{12}))\u0026amp;=\\ell_{12}\\cdot r_{21}\\\\ g(f(r_{21})) \u0026amp;= \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{v_1}. \\end{aligned}\\] We then need to supply a homotopy from this data to \\(\\ensuremath{\\text{id}}_{C_2}\\), which consists of a section and pathovers over \\(C_2\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} p_1\u0026amp;:g(f(v_1))=v_1\\\\ p_2\u0026amp;:g(f(v_1))=v_2\\\\ H_\\ell\u0026amp;:\\mathsf{tr}(\\ell_{12})(p_1)=p_2\\\\ H_r\u0026amp;:\\mathsf{tr}(r_{21})(p_2)=p_1. \\end{aligned}\\] which simplifies to \\[\\begin{aligned} p_1\u0026amp;:v_1=v_1\\\\ p_2\u0026amp;:v_1=v_2\\\\ H_\\ell\u0026amp;:g(f(\\ell_{12}))^{-1}\\cdot p_1\\cdot \\ell_{12}=p_2\\\\ H_r\u0026amp;:=g(f(r_{21}))^{-1}\\cdot p_2\\cdot r_{21}= p_1 \\end{aligned}\\] and then to \\[\\begin{aligned} p_1\u0026amp;:v_1=v_1\\\\ p_2\u0026amp;:v_1=v_2\\\\ H_\\ell\u0026amp;:(\\ell_{12}\\cdot r_{21})^{-1}\\cdot p_1\\cdot \\ell_{12}=p_2\\\\ H_r\u0026amp;:\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{v_1}\\cdot p_2\\cdot r_{21}= p_1 \\end{aligned}\\]\nTo solve all of these constraints we can choose \\(p_1\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{v_1}\\), which by consulting either \\(H_\\ell\\) or \\(H_r\\) requires that we take \\(p_2\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}{r_{21}}^{-1}\\).\nNow examining \\(f\\circ g\\), we have \\[\\begin{aligned} f(g(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{base}}))\u0026amp;=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{base}}\u0026amp;\\\\ f(g(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{loop}}))\u0026amp;=f(\\ell_{12}\\cdot r_{21})=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{loop}} \\end{aligned}\\] and so we have an easy proof that this is the identity.\nThe proof of the more general case \\(C_n \\simeq C_{n-1}\\) is very similar. Take the maps \\(f:C_n\\to C_{n-1}\\), \\(g:C_{n-1}\\to C_n\\) to be \\[\\begin{aligned} f(v_i)=v_i\u0026amp;\\quad(i=1,\\ldots,n-1) \u0026amp; g(v_i)\u0026amp;=v_i\u0026amp;\\quad(i=1,\\ldots,n-1)\\\\ f(v_n)=v_1\u0026amp;\\quad\u0026amp; g(e_{i,i+1})\u0026amp;=e_{i,i+1}\u0026amp;\\quad(i=1,\\ldots,n-2)\\\\ f(e_{i,i+1})=e_{i,i+1}\u0026amp;\\quad(i=1,\\ldots,n-1)\u0026amp; g(e_{n-1,1})\u0026amp;=e_{n-1,n}\\cdot e_{n,1}\u0026amp;\\\\ f(e_{n-1,n})=e_{n-1,1}\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\\\ f(e_{n,1})=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{v_1}\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(f\\) should be thought of as shrinking \\(e_{n,1}\\) so that \\(v_n\\) coalesces into \\(v_1\\).\nThe proof that \\(g\\circ f\\sim\\ensuremath{\\text{id}}_{C_n}\\) proceeds as follows: the composition is definitionally the identity except \\[\\begin{aligned} g(f(v_n))\u0026amp;=v_1\\\\ g(f(e_{n-1,n}))\u0026amp;=e_{n-1,n}\\cdot e_{n,1}\\\\ g(f(e_{n,1}))\u0026amp;= \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{v_1}. \\end{aligned}\\] Guided by our previous experience we choose \\({e_{n,1}}^{-1}:g(f(v_n))=v_n\\), and define the pathovers by transport.\nThe proof that \\(f\\circ g\\sim\\ensuremath{\\text{id}}_{C_{n-1}}\\) requires only noting that \\(f(g(e_{n-1,1}))=f(e_{n-1,n}\\cdot e_{n,1})=e_{n-1,1}\\cdot\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{v_1}=e_{n-1,1}\\). ◻\nCorollary 2. All polygons are equivalent to \\(S^1\\), i.e. we have a term in \\(\\prod_{n:\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{N}}}||C_n=S^1||\\), and hence \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{Gon}}\\) is a subtype of \\(\\mathrm{EM}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}},1)\\).\nProof. We can add \\(n-1\\) points to \\(S^1\\) and use Lemma 3. ◻\nDefinition 11. For \\(k:\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{N}}\\) define \\(m_k:\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{Gon}}\\to\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{Gon}}\\) where \\(m_k:C_n\\to C_{kn}\\) adds \\(k\\) vertices between each of the original verticies of \\(C_n\\).\nWith \\(m_k\\) we can start with a surface that has pentagonal plus hexagonal links, and apply \\(m_6\\) to the pentagons and \\(m_5\\) to the hexagons, and have a type family that is the tangent bundle (because it comes from the link) but where every fiber has 30 vertices.\n3.5 New in 2025: The classical adding of angles is given by horizontal composition Let me start a new discussion of composing faces. Consider Figure 8 and the diamond on the left. Denote the clockwise triangular path around the left triangle by \\(bcab\\), and around the right by \\(bdcb\\). These are loops at \\(b\\). Say that the tangent map \\(T\\) satisfies \\(T(bcab)=R\\) where \\(R\\) is rotation by 1 notch in the 4-sided polygon \\(Tb\\), and similarly \\(T(bdcb)=R\\) as well.\nSince \\(bcab\\) has a filler 2-cell, which we will call \\(f_1\\), we know that \\(T(f_1)=H\\) where \\(H:R=\\ensuremath{\\text{id}}\\) is a path in \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{Aut}}(Tb)\\) from \\(R\\) to the identity. Similarly for \\(f_2\\), the filler for \\(bdcb\\).\nThe two faces can be horizontally composed giving \\(f_1\\star f_2\\), which fills the diamond \\(bdcab\\). It also gives us a way to combine the two homotopies into a single homotopy \\(H\\star H:R^2=\\ensuremath{\\text{id}}\\).\nIn this way, given an explicit ordering of the faces (a “plan” for visiting all faces of the manifold), we can “sum” the curvature. For our ocatahedron where each triangle produces a rotation of \\(R\\), we’d get \\(R^8\\).\nThis sum will be very similar to concatenating edges that circulate once around each face.\nHorizontal concatenation. 3.6 The higher inductive type \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}\\) We will create our first combinatorial surface, a 2-sphere. We will adopt the convention that a subscript indicates the dimension of a subskeleton of a complex. For instance, we have \\(\\mathsf{base}:S^1_0\\).\nDefinition 12. The HIT \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}_0\\) is just 6 points, intended as the 0-skeleton of an octahedron, with vertices named after the colors on the faces of a famous Central European puzzle cube. \\[w, y, b, r, g, o : \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}_0\\]\nDefinition 13. The HIT \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}_1\\) is the 1-skeleton of an octahedron. \\[\\begin{aligned} w, y, b, r, g, o \u0026amp;: \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}_1 \u0026amp; yg \u0026amp;: y=g \\\\ wb \u0026amp;: w=b \u0026amp; yo \u0026amp;: y=o \\\\ wr \u0026amp;: w=r \u0026amp; br \u0026amp;: b=r \\\\ wg \u0026amp;: w=g \u0026amp; rg \u0026amp;: r=g \\\\ wo \u0026amp;: w=o \u0026amp; go \u0026amp;: g=o \\\\ yb \u0026amp;: y=b \u0026amp; ob \u0026amp;: o=b \\\\ yr \u0026amp;: y=r \\end{aligned}\\]\nDefinition 14. The HIT \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}\\) is an octahedron: \\[\\begin{aligned} w, y, b, r, g, o \u0026amp;: \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}\\\\ wb \u0026amp;: w=b \u0026amp; br \u0026amp;: b=r \u0026amp; wbr \u0026amp;: wb\\cdot br\\cdot wr^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_w \\\\ wr \u0026amp;: w=r \u0026amp; rg \u0026amp;: r=g \u0026amp; wrg \u0026amp;: wr\\cdot rg\\cdot wg^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_w \\\\ wg \u0026amp;: w=g \u0026amp; go \u0026amp;: g=o \u0026amp; wgo \u0026amp;: wg\\cdot go\\cdot wo^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_w \\\\ wo \u0026amp;: w=o \u0026amp; ob \u0026amp;: o=b \u0026amp; wob \u0026amp;: wo\\cdot ob\\cdot wb^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_w \\\\ yb \u0026amp;: y=b \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \u0026amp; yrb \u0026amp;: yr\\cdot rb\\cdot yb^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_y \\\\ yr \u0026amp;: y=r \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \u0026amp; ygr \u0026amp;: yg\\cdot gr\\cdot yr^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_y \\\\ yg \u0026amp;: y=g \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \u0026amp; yog \u0026amp;: yo\\cdot og\\cdot yg^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_y \\\\ yo \u0026amp;: y=o \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \u0026amp; ybo \u0026amp;: yb\\cdot bo\\cdot yo^{-1} = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_y \\end{aligned}\\]\nThe HIT \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}\\) which has 6 points, 12 1-paths, 8 2-paths. We have obvious maps \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}_0\\xrightarrow[]{i_0} \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}_1\\xrightarrow[]{i_1} \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{O}}\\) that include each skeleton into the next-higher-dimensional skeleton.\n3.7 Groupoid operations on higher inductive combinatorial manifolds Let \\(M:\\mathsf{SimpCompSet_2}\\) be a combinatorial 2-manifold and \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\mathcal{H}(M):\\mathsf{CombMfd_2}\\) the corresponding higher inductive type. \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) has triangular 2-faces just as \\(M\\) does, except they are 2-paths in the HoTT sense. If two faces \\(bca\\) and \\(bdc\\) share the edge \\(bc\\) (see Figure 9), then we can define an operation that combines the combinatorics of simplices with the higher groupoid operations generated by our HIT.\nConsider Figure 9 and the 2-paths \\(bac: ba\\cdot ac=bc\\) and \\(bdc: bd\\cdot dc = bc\\). The 2-path concatenation \\(bac\\cdot bdc^{-1}\\) is a path in \\(ba\\cdot ac = bd\\cdot dc\\). And from there we see we have a 4-gon \\(abdc:\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_b=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_b\\). In this way we can concatenate faces across common boundaries once we choose a common vertex (in this case \\(b\\)).\nConcatenating the triangles \\(bac\\) and \\(bdc\\) gives the 4-gon \\(abdc\\). We will have two use cases for this operation. The first is to consider the concatenation of all the faces of \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\), i.e. a term \\(f_\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}:\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a\\) corresponding to \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) itself. This will play the role of the “fundamental homology class” from classical topology, which is an object on which 2-forms can be evaluated to compute their value on the whole manifold.\nDefinition 15. If we have a combinatorial manifold \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}:\\mathsf{CombMfd_2}\\) (or a combinatorial manifold minus some isolated zeros \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\mathbb{N}\\setminus Z\\)) and \\(a:\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}_0\\) is a vertex, a total face of \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) is a term \\(f_\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}:\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a\\) given by any choice of ordering of the faces \\(\\{f_i\\}\\), a vertex \\(v_i\\) in each face, and terms \\(a=v_i\\) for each face.\nOf course there are many choices in this definition of total face!\nThe second use case for concatenating faces is to create a HIT related to \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) but without some of the point constructors. Figure 10 illustrates the equivalence.\nConcatenating the six triangles in the approrpiate way produces a 2-path in \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_v=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_v\\) and removes the vertex at the center. Definition 16. If \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}:\\mathsf{CombMfd_2}\\) is a combinatorial manifold and \\(Z\\subset \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}_0\\) is a set of vertices in \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) with members \\(Z=\\{z_0,\\ldots,z_n\\}\\), then denote by \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\setminus Z\\) the type given by omitting the vertices in \\(Z\\) from the constructors in all dimensions where they appeared. Call the points of \\(Z\\) isolated if no two of them are neighbors, i.e. we have \\(\\prod_{z:Z}\\mathop{\\mathrm{\\mathsf{link}}}(z)\\cap Z=\\emptyset\\). In the isolated case \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\setminus Z\\) has boundary circles where each vertex was removed.\nDefinition 17. If we have \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\setminus Z\\) for some isolated set of verticies \\(Z\\), then for each \\(z:Z\\) we can compose all the faces which contain \\(z\\), forming a new face (see Figure 10). In this way we produce a HIT called \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}_Z\\), which is no longer combinatorial. We call \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}_Z\\) the replacement of \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) without \\(Z\\).\nLemma 4. If \\(Z\\) are isolated points of \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) then we have \\(\\mathcal{R}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}})=_\\mathsf{Type}\\mathcal{R}(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}_Z)\\).\nProof. We will prove that concatenating two faces of \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{M}}\\) as in Figure 9 produces an equivalent type. Let \\(A\\) be the constructor given on the left that includes the edge \\(bc\\), and \\(B\\) the constructor on the right. We will define functions on constructors. Let \\(f:A\\to B\\) be\n\\(f(a:A)=a:B, f(b)=b, f(c)=c, f(d)=d\\)\n\\(f(ab)=ab, f(bd)=bd, f(dc)=dc, f(ca)=ca\\)\n\\(f(bc)=bdc\\)\n\\(f(abc)=abcd\\)\n\\(f(bdc)=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{bd\\cdot dc}\\)\nwhich “squishes the right face onto its right \u0026gt;-shaped boundary.” In the other direction let \\(g:B\\to A\\) be the inclusion of all the constructors of dimension 1 and 2, and set \\(g(abdc)=abc*bdc\\), which denotes the concatenation operation across the shared edge.\nWe must provide a term \\(gf:\\prod_{x:A}g(f(x))=x\\) which requires supplying four paths, five pathovers, and two faceovers. The four paths are \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a\\), \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_b\\), \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_c\\) and \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_c\\). Four of the pathovers are \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{ab}\\), \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{bd}\\), \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{dc}\\), \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{ca}\\). It remains to find terms\n\\(\\mathit{gfbc}:\\mathsf{apd}(bc)(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_b)=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_c\\)\n\\(\\mathit{gfabc}:\\mathsf{apd}(abc)(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{ab}\\cdot \\mathit{gfbc}\\cdot \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{ca})=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a}\\), i.e. \\(\\mathit{gfabc}:g(f(abc))^{-1}\\cdot (\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{ab}\\cdot \\mathit{gfbc}\\cdot \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{ca})\\cdot abc = \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a}\\)\n\\(\\mathit{gfbdc}:\\mathsf{apd}(bdc)(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{bd}\\cdot \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{dc}\\cdot \\mathit{gfbc}^{-1})=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_b}\\), i.e. \\(\\mathit{gfbdc}:g(f(bdc))^{-1}\\cdot (\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{bd}\\cdot \\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{dc}\\cdot \\mathit{gfbc}^{-1})\\cdot bdc\\)\nwhich are supplied by\n\\(cbd:cb\\cdot bd\\cdot dc=\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_c\\)\n\\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_a}}\\)\n\\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}_b}}\\).\nWe must also provide a term \\(\\mathit{fg}:\\prod_{x:B}f(g(x))=x\\) which is \\(\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{refl}}\\) on all constructors. ◻\nChristensen, D.

I felt like a genius for noticing that both these artists were philologists who were adapting material that inspired them, and seeking such a book!\nHere are some notes that will convey what I felt was important from the book.\nThe medieval myths Wagner was working earlier in the arc of philological knowledge than Tolkien, but we can think of them both as being inspired by Germanic and Norse/Icelandic poems and legends.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re dealing here in particular with the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda and the Völsunga saga, all written in Old Norse in the 13th century. In addition there is the middle-high German adaptation, also from the 13th century, the Nibelungenlied.\nTwo philologists The goals of these two artists were similar, in that both were fascinated by this medieval material, and wanted to adapt it and convert it into stories that were relevant to their national identity. Some notes:\nWagner read the original stories for inspiration. He didn\u0026rsquo;t try to do a straight adaptation. The Ring seemed to many folks afterward to be more authentic than the originals, despite all Wagner\u0026rsquo;s additions! Tolkien did such things too \u0026ndash; creating material but pretending it was just missing before. It let him (Tolkien) combine his fiction writing with his scholarly research. What better way to explain your hypothesis about the resolution of conflicting data than to write the missing story? The Völsunga saga compiler did something similar, compiling earlier stories into their own version. Wagner didn\u0026rsquo;t think the Nibelungenlied felt authentic enough, or mythic enough, but when he was shown the Eddas he was inpsired. Opinions differ on how much Old Norse Wagner knew. It was not none. But he owned both original Eddas and translations. Both used archaic vocabulary, for example in Wagner: Friedel (lover), Wal (bodies of slain warriors), Mage (kinsman), Minne (love), Mut (mood). Both used archaic grammar (inversions), e.g. in LotR, \u0026ldquo;Only to the North these tidings came.\u0026rdquo; Both used wordplay, for example in Wagner zur Wal kor ich ihn mir (I chose him to be among the slain), playing on the meaning of Valkyrie. This blew my mind: the whole Ring is in alliterative verse, like the Old Norse was! alliterative verse has rules for repeating consonants in a pattern like c c / c x or c x / c x or others. for example the line Schwarzes, schwieliges / Schwefelgezwerg! Wagner bent a few rules, but the full rules weren\u0026rsquo;t inferred until later in the 19th century so we forgive him. Shared adapted elements Tom Shippey calls Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Ring the most important medieval adaptation of the 19th century, and Lord of the Rings the most important of the 20th. Here are the elements of Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Ring that are shared with Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Rings, and which have common origin in the medieval texts:\nSlaying a dragon (Eddas, Völsunga saga) Ring-quarrelling relatives (Poetic Edda) Reforged sword (Völsunga saga) Hiding in a cave with the ring (Eddas) Riddle game (Poetic Edda) Dwarves as creators of artifacts (Eddas) Shared original elements This section is the main point. Wagner made the ring in his story much more significant than it had been in the medieval stories. He also focused on the nature of power. Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s story has many parallels to this Wagner-specific material. This is therefore the piece that points most clearly to an influence from Wagner to Tolkien. The agenda of this book is to clear away many noisy discussions to ascertain what is the cleanest evidence, internal to the stories, that there may have been such influence.\nRecall though that Tolkien is not adapting the original myths and Wagner is. Tolkien did adapt the original myths though (in The New Lay of the Völsungs and The New Lay of Gudrún)! Vink\u0026rsquo;s book looks at those, but I\u0026rsquo;m skipping them here.\nBoth rings grant \u0026ldquo;world domination\u0026rdquo;, and both rings seem to grant this proportional to stature: Gollum and Alberich do not gain much power. The ring (or its tarnhelm sibling) grants invisibility. Fear of death fuels the desire for power. Wagner: and this causes lovelessness Tolkien: it causes rebellion against God to gain power over life and death Nature is very important. There are personifications thereof (Rhinemaidens, ents). Tolkien is interested in good vs evil. Wagner is interested in love vs power. Here lie many dissertations. Disagreements Both men wrote a lot about their process and their opinions. Here are some key points that separate them.\nTolkien: fantasy is about creating a secondary world. But dramatizing it (meaning, on stage) creates in effect a tertiary world of actors and effects, and it\u0026rsquo;s never successful. In fantasy (prose) one can say \u0026ldquo;there was bread on the table,\u0026rdquo; and the reader fills in the sensory and evocative detail. On stage one must choose a specific loaf. But perhaps they are not so far apart: Wagner was against hyper-realism on stage (though he overdid it anyway). Wagner uses music to convey much of the drama. This is the most important point that\u0026rsquo;s not explored by the agenda of this particular book. Is the Ring a tragedy, and LotR a comedy (or Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s word, eucatastrophe)? Some people see it that way. But both stories end with a mythical age coming to an end, and the world ready to begin again with more mundane people. So maybe not so different. What did Tolkien think of Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Ring? There\u0026rsquo;s no evidence he heard an entire Ring cycle. Possibly Siegfried. But he read the libretto, possibly only Die Walküre. One encounters that Tolkien said \u0026ldquo;Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\u0026rdquo; This is in \u0026ldquo;Letter 230\u0026rdquo; to his publisher Allen \u0026amp; Unwin. But he was not referring to Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Ring, he was referring to the Norse sagas! 90% of Tolkien-Wagner discourse is rendered moot by this observation. Appendix: königsproblem Vink\u0026rsquo;s book spends some time observing that the medieval stories are contradictory on a certain plot point, and that Wagner and Tolkien both knew this and had their separate solutions. This raises the whole process whereby a modern creator decides to fill in gaps in older material, as a way of adapting and extending that material. This is one of the things that I love about Tolkien, and so it helped transfer some of that adoration to Wagner.\nThe question for philologists was: what was the matter with the ring cursed by Andvari, found by Sigurd in the dragon\u0026rsquo;s hoard, such that Brynhild demanded Sigurd\u0026rsquo;s death? It arises from a gap in the Poetic Edda (we are missing most of the Great Lay of Sigurd). The Prose Edda and Nibelungenlied contradict each other.\nIt became known that all of these medieval sources are adaptations of a 5th century story. What was the story? Wagner came up with a solution.\nTolkien came up with another in The New Lay of the Völsungs (Tom Shippey wrote a nerdy inside joke: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps the \u0026lsquo;New Lay\u0026rsquo; was meant to fill out the \u0026lsquo;Old Lay,\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;Short Lay,\u0026rsquo; and so replace the \u0026lsquo;Great Lay.\u0026rsquo;)\nThe drama elements at issue are something like this:\nSigurd meets Brynhild. Sigurd gives Brynhild a ring (sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s Andvaranaut). Sigurd meets Gunnar. Sigurd agrees to win Brynhild for Gunnar by taking Gunnar\u0026rsquo;s form. Sigurd does this and moreover lays with Brynhild. Sigurd takes from her the above ring to mark the conquest (all in Gunnar\u0026rsquo;s form). Sigurd wins Gudrun. Sigurd gives Gudrun the ring. Gudrun taunts Brynhild that Sigurd slept with her, and as proof shows her her ring. Brynhild is humiliated. Wagner\u0026rsquo;s solution was to have the ring be The Ring, eliminate 7-9, and replace these with Brünhilde seeing the ring on Siegfried\u0026rsquo;s finger.\nTolkien\u0026rsquo;s solution was hard for me to differentiate from my own 1-10 above, probably because he was hewing closer to the source material and I am too dense to see the subtle distinctions.\n","date":1711920148,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711920148,"objectID":"b9f96dbd7ab1087eaf55665d4b9a7e70","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2024-03-31-wagner-and-tolkien/","publishdate":"2024-03-31T17:22:28-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/2024-03-31-wagner-and-tolkien/","section":"posts","summary":"Wagner and Tolkien: Mythmakers is a book by Renée Vink.\n","tags":[],"title":"Wagner and Tolkien","type":"posts"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Tech"],"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve owned the book The Future Does Not Compute by Stephen Talbott for almost 30 years, but for a million reasons it was only recently that I focused on reading it. What I found was what I always knew I\u0026rsquo;d find: thoughtful and clear reflections on some problems with computing. I want to relate some of his main arguments, and give you an idea of what an eloquent writer he is.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve organized quotes from the book into three themes:\ndestructiveness: computers bring about change; they render lifeless things that were alive in us, which is bad our existing failures: the destructiveness is the continuation of an arc we\u0026rsquo;ve been on for centuries synthesis: we can use this opportunity to clarify what being human is and can be Put on your thinking cap There are a few key points of view, and if you resonate with them then the book will speak to you. Here\u0026rsquo;s the TL;DR quote:\nI am not sure we will be given this many decades [as with TV] to become properly aware of our computers. For what is directly at risk now \u0026ndash; what the computer asks us to abdicate \u0026ndash; are our independent powers of awareness. Yet these powers are the only means by which we can raise ourselves above the machine.\nThe key words here are \u0026ldquo;aware\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;above.\u0026rdquo; What is the nature of human life and awareness, and how is the computer a debasement of it? Talbott is more or less a reactionary, longing for a time when humans were more integrated with nature and more richly alive. Another important word in the book is \u0026ldquo;meaning.\u0026rdquo; For Talbott, there is a state of being where our lives and our language have a living meaning, attached to the natural world and to each other. The antithesis of this is analytical logic, which drains words of their living qualities and shrinks them until they mean more and more specific, and abstract, things. It\u0026rsquo;s such a novel paradox for me, to think that the more specific we make a word (examples include, say, \u0026ldquo;atom,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;transparent,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;oak,\u0026rdquo; whatever, really) the more abstract it is. I\u0026rsquo;d have thought we were making them more concrete by being specific. But he\u0026rsquo;s right, we have to divorce from the oak tree a little bit to define a species of tree \u0026ldquo;scientifically.\u0026rdquo;\nOh, and here\u0026rsquo;s a fun prescient bit:\nOne can, in this regard, venture a fairly safe prediction: over the coming years, fringe Net phenomena such as flame wars, weird impersonations, the more bizarre forms of underground culture, pornographic commerce, manifestations of psychosis \u0026hellip; will grow increasingly pronounced and erratic, while at the same time the reasoned mechanisms for filtering “strict business” from the more chaotic background noise of the Net will steadily gain in effectiveness.\nDestructivness There\u0026rsquo;s hucksterism out there. We can all detect that computers have always been oversold to us by inventors and corporations. But the scam has many layers and some of them are accidental and insidious. Talbott is trying to identify these. They are the lies that we tell ourselves collectively when we dream of the power of computing.\nThat what is inside the computer is just as rich as what we had put into it:\nData and information are the raw materials of wisdom. That is the lie.\nThat the gap between our human activity and the digital versions thereof is small:\nThe computer willingly places its mimicking intelligence at our service. All it asks of us is one small thing: that we allow it to start with information or data, and to proceed from there by means of mechanized logic.\nThat the hopes and dreams we project onto the computer are actually just hopes and dreams, and are unrelated to the computer:\nThere is, after all, one absolutely unavoidable fact: technologies for “bringing people together” do not necessarily bring people together.\nThat nowhere are the tradeoffs more depressing than in education:\nOne wants so badly to like what Seymour Papert has done.\nThat our fears around \u0026ldquo;screen time\u0026rdquo; are almost certainly justified, but more spiritual than we usually speak of:\nIt is simply backward to immerse the elementary school student in an artificial, computerized environment before he has learned much at all about the world. How can he translate the terms of artifice, the language of representation, back into a reality he has never known?\nThat computers do not mediate so much as distort:\nthe virtue of immediacy possessed by the technical device as such is not a virtue of the content mediated by that device\nI had never reflected in this way on apps like The Elements, which I thought of as wonderful eductational tools to show my kids. What if my experience of the app is rich because I have touched so many of the materials in the period table with my senses, whereas a child who has not is receivng a different and poorer experience than I? And what should I do with the fact that I never did reflect in this way?\nOur existing failures Now I need you to summon some of your skepticism about capitalism, the industrial revolution, plutocrats and kleptocrats. Done? Then try this:\nComputers didn\u0026rsquo;t bring anything essentially new; they were just going to be better machines than we had yet managed to be.\nThere are so many galaxy-brain takes in this book that point out that we have plenty of evidence that computers will definitely not do what we hope they will, because we already confronted an exactly analogous moment. Think that the internet will help reduce feelings of isolation?\nWho constitutes the society that isolated them in the first place \u0026ndash; persons different from those who will make the Net whatever it becomes?\nHoping for a utopia where barriers are removed? In 2023 I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of Uber, Airbnb, or Etsy:\nWhen we\u0026rsquo;re all in the electronic marketplace together, will our enemy be any less ourselves than when we were all in the industrial marketplace together? When the Net subsumes all social functions, will the balance of healthy and destructive forces be more positive than we already know it to be?\nThink that lowering barriers to communication will bring the world together, and that examples of dark toxicity are exceptions to this built-in promise?\ncould it be that what we so eagerly embrace, unawares, are the powers of dissolution themselves?\nWant to launch satellites to bring the internet (and Facebook) to villages in Africa?\nin attacking any local problem we must yield first of all, not to the meanings inherent in the problem, but to the constraining necessity of the global system itself. The village farmers in Nepal may not feel any need of a satellite dish, but they will receive one nevertheless\nThink that VR kayaking on the PlayStation 5 is related to actual kayaking?\nWe speak of “immersive” virtual reality, but it is immersion in a “nothing” that is compounded of mathematical abstractions and cut off from Nature\u0026rsquo;s lawfulness.\nThink that astronomy constitutes \u0026ldquo;informed worship\u0026rdquo; and brings us closer to the universe? (I still think this after reading the quote):\nGalileo\u0026rsquo;s world-changing instrument pushed the moon farther from us. Where once we felt ourselves within the moon\u0026rsquo;s sphere of influence, we woke up to find the moon far, far away, unconnected to ourselves.\nTo computerize something we must first change it:\nEvery claim that “the computer cannot do so-and-so” is met by the effort \u0026ndash; more or less successful \u0026ndash; to analyze so-and-so into a set of pure, formal structures.\nWhat might the future bring? (These days I think of ChatGPT and how often thinkers (and employers) invite us to find uses for it.)\nOur experiment with the computer consists of the effort to discover every possible aspect of the human mind that can be expressed or echoed mechanically \u0026ndash; simulated by a machine \u0026ndash; and then to reconstruct society around those aspects. In other words, after a few centuries of philosophical reductionism, we are now venturing into a new, practical reductionism: we are determined to find out how much of our mental functioning we can in fact delegate to the computer.\nSynthesis: taking a stab at defining what it means to be human What I\u0026rsquo;m most grateful for are Talbott\u0026rsquo;s unsubstantiated claims about what being human used to feel like. He enlists Owen Barfield to do some of this job, and I\u0026rsquo;m thankful as well to have learned more about this Inkling, Tolkien fan that I am. I take all these claims with a grain of salt, but I find them edifying, inspiring, and lovely. And they help me see what I find disquieting about the computer, by contrast.\nWhen we debate questions such as \u0026ldquo;what is mathematics?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;what is chess?\u0026rdquo;, Talbott offers yet another galaxy-brain framing, which I have found pretty transformative:\nIt is always ourselves we work on, whether we realize it or not. There is no other work to be done in the world.\nAs someone who pursues mathematics for primarily aesthetic reasons, this resonates quite a bit. I can definitely believe that I am mostly trying to have experiences and change myself, rather than somehow contribute wisdom to my peers, a secondary goal that is anyway aligned with the first one. But I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not trying to increase the count of theorems in the world, which is what theorem-proving researchers are optimizing their software for. And those researchers are mostly not grappling with the implications for humans, except to dismiss any concern as luddism.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s definitely going for something very spiritual:\nI am convinced that much of the “community” we experience is more an effort to bury the loneliness than to reckon with its causes. And I suspect that the causes have a lot to do with our failure to acknowledge, let alone to have any useful language for grasping, the spiritual self whose cut-off condition is at issue.\nEven the simple act of making a pros and cons list is too reductionist for him:\nHave you, or has anyone you know, ever made an important decision by weighing all related factors, adding them up, and then obeying the sum? This is not really your future we\u0026rsquo;re talking about; it\u0026rsquo;s your past. The real question is, what do you choose to become \u0026ndash; despite what you are now?\nHe\u0026rsquo;s pretty worried that he\u0026rsquo;s in a double bind, however:\neven to argue that there is a threat from computers \u0026ndash; if that threat is seen as fixed and objective \u0026ndash; is only to further our descent. This is my own greatest challenge, for where my strong predilection is to argue the facts, I should instead seek to awaken. Awakenings prepare the way for a new future, and for different facts.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a down-to-earth statement of an alternate vision:\nThere is no neat algorithm for either carving or sailing a little wooden boat in the usual, childlike manner \u0026ndash; and yet these activities offer a great deal of worthwhile experience, from which a later appreciation of mathematics and engineering can most healthily arise.\nHe spends some time, and some eloquent writing, describing what a healthy and connected existence might look like. He, and Owen Barfield, feel that we has such a life during the middle ages (in a narrow western sense, naturally). We lived in harmony with our stories, with nature, and with words we felt to live in an integrated whole with the world, not mere tokens split away from it.\nBefore the scientific revolution the world was more like a garment men wore about them than a stage on which they moved\nOwen Barfield\u0026rsquo;s remark that “it is not man who made the myths, but the myths that made man.”\nIs it our real yearning simply to become alive again, and to know the world as living?\nThe discipline of consciousness is not a preparation for truth-gathering; it is the increasingly harmonious resonance between the laws of the world and the laws of our own thinking activity, which are the same laws expressed outwardly and inwardly.\nFinally I want to mention one more Owen Barfield idea which has stuck with me. It\u0026rsquo;s the idea that every word is a metaphor. This story checks out! Like how I just said \u0026ldquo;the story checks out\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo;, and how I said \u0026ldquo;galaxy-brain\u0026rdquo; earlier, or \u0026ldquo;double bind\u0026rdquo;.\nnearly all linguistic symbols have a figurative origin\nNewton\u0026rsquo;s use of gravitas to describe the force of gravitation was metaphorical \u0026ndash; untrue on its face; it made no more sense, given the received meaning of gravitas, than we would make today if we explained the moon\u0026rsquo;s revolution as resulting from its desire for the earth. And yet, as with many metaphors, it did make sense when one looked through the false statements and, with their essential aid, began to grasp the intended (new) meanings.\nThe Barvield POV is to notice this, and then to wonder what it would feel like for these terms to be something even stronger than a metaphor. Where my brain being galaxy-sized is somehow deeply true, and connects me with the galaxy into one holisitic concept. I find that very challenging to imagine, but very tempting, and I am definitely in agreement that no computer could do it, and no computer programmer will ever try, because computing entails impoverishment.\nSpeaking of \u0026ldquo;reactionary\u0026rdquo;… There was bad news in the book as well. I found a few places where I was shocked to hear the voice of a political reactionary who is not terribly enamored of many of his fellow citizens.\nall that is best in the uniquely Western development of scientific discipline: the habit of rigorous, detached observation, the finely tuned mental machinery of analysis, the requirement that theories work\nHere he is reacting to Jerry Mander, author of In The Absence Of The Sacred, with phraseology that would be at home in National Review.\nMander repeats uncritically the wholly uncertain claim that we face crises of ozone depletion and global warming\nhis ill-advised singling out of Ronald Reagan\nMaybe a blossoming anti-woke crusader?\nabsurd, guilt-driven expressions of political correctness\nWe\u0026rsquo;re no longer going to let those TV moguls keep us down and reveling in smut.\nFinally, this asinine quote left me feeling unseen to say the least:\nhow many students of mathematics still look to the night sky with wonder?\n","date":1693258395,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693258395,"objectID":"af87c7d7c3a378574829ad8642d73c16","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2023-08-28-talbott-review/","publishdate":"2023-08-28T17:33:15-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/2023-08-28-talbott-review/","section":"posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve owned the book The Future Does Not Compute by Stephen Talbott for almost 30 years, but for a million reasons it was only recently that I focused on reading it.

His stated goal was to show that the natural numbers could be created inside logic. But why was he doing this? What benefits did he think this would have and what value statements did he provide? I will show that what Frege valued was the rigorous pursuit of mathematical truth, and that he viewed his own contributions as entirely methodological. I will further show that this view, that logic serves the broader mathematical endeavor, is consistent with major streams of foundational mathematical activity today. I will examine type theory and the communities who use it to cultivate a flourishing mathematical practice. But lurking inside this rosy picture is a new crisis for mathematics. Ironically, this is not another instance of the crises of the 19th and 20th centuries, where mathematics required a renewed commitment to rigor in order to avoid confusion, paradoxes, or errors. There are indeed vocal elements today who claim that we are in just such a crisis! But this time we have all the tools we need to achieve the desired standards. Unfortunately, the proponents of those very tools have indirectly brought about a crisis of values, by supporting and celebrating a nihilistic, computational, and literally dehumanizing view of mathematics. What we need now is to repel these attacks with a new commitment to Frege\u0026rsquo;s values: that logic is a tool of the inherently human exploration of mathematics, and not a value unto itself.\n1. Frege\u0026rsquo;s goals: logic in service of mainstream mathematics Frege\u0026rsquo;s first big document, the Begriffsschrift (1879), begins its preface with the sentence \u0026ldquo;The recognition of a scientific truth generally passes through several stages of certainty.\u0026rdquo;1 The rest of the document, and indeed Frege\u0026rsquo;s entire body of work, is devoted to upgrading the certainty of scientific truth. The value is truth, and his methodology would help lend additional certainty to it. He does not level any criticisms at the agenda inside of mathematics or science generally. It\u0026rsquo;s true that he argues for what we would call a realist take on science and mathematics, i.e. the position that mathematical objects are real objects in a platonic realm of ideas. It\u0026rsquo;s also true that he argues against a psychological frame for such objects. But these are philosophical underpinnings, and again do not second guess the activities that the practitioners choose to focus on. So the arc of scientific inquiry, and of mathematical research, is a fixed background object that he seems to approve of and wants to support.\nThe support he wants to offer is an epistemological upgrade: more airtight arguments which are more grounded in logic. Delivering this upgrade has two parts. First Frege will add constructions to logic itself, notably universal quantifiers, a primitive system of types, and the observation that equality comes in multiple kinds. This enables the logic to support a broader class of reasoning.\nWith his suite of logical tools, Frege can offer his second idea, which is the Begriffsschrift, or concept script, itself. This is a notational tool for a mathematician to apply the laws of logic to some starting expressions that have been suitably encoded, working down the page applying laws of inference from the small permitted library, until a conclusion is reached. It is crucial that the concept script is a new notation, with little in common with spoken and written human languages except the use of letters for variables (he cites \u0026ldquo;the inadequacy of language\u0026rdquo;2). Here is an example that in modern notation would be \u0026ldquo;B ∧ (B → A) → A\u0026rdquo; or in words \u0026ldquo;if B holds, and B implies A, then A holds\u0026rdquo;3:\nand here is his diagram showing that his expressions can subsume the \u0026ldquo;square of opposition\u0026rdquo;, a sort of ad-hoc logical tool used over the preceding centuries45:\nFrege\u0026rsquo;s proposal can be expressed as a layer diagram, where lower levels support the ones above, and higher layers make use of the ones directly underneath:\nScience and Mathematics ----------------------- Concept script ----------------------- Logic He wanted the concept script and logical framework to be adopted, to be used by mathematicians in daily practice, or at least when extra certainty was desired. The concept script is the interface to the logic, and so if a practitioner were to successfully use the concept script to prove a result, that result would be connected all the way to the logical bedrock of knowledge:\nThe firmest proof is obviously the purely logical, which, prescinding from [i.e., holding itself apart from] the particularity of things, is based solely on the laws on which all knowledge rests.6\nThe user is empowered to avoid all intuitive leaps; the proof would be free of gaps:\nSo that nothing intuitive could intrude here unnoticed, everything had to depend on the chain of inference being free of gaps.7\nEverything that is necessary for a valid inference is fully expressed [in the concept script]; but what is not necessary is mostly not even indicated; nothing is left to guessing.8\nHis comparison of the concept script to a microscope is very illuminating. First of all it is a tool which we use to examine the true subject matter at hand, namely scientific truth. But used properly the microscope does not set the agenda or ask the questions. It is a tool that lays alongside the primary inquiry.\nHe even includes a roadmap of future goals for the concept script, to support even more scientific areas such as geometry, analysis, and physics:\nIt seems to me to be even easier to extend the domain of this formula language to geometry. Only a few more symbols would have to be added for the intuitive relations that occur here. In this way one would obtain a kind of analysis situs. The transition to the pure theory of motion and thence to mechanics and physics might follow here.9\nThe analogy to a software library gaining features over time is hard to avoid, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it needs to be avoided! But the point I want to keep emphasizing is that he is not trying to disturb the trajectory of these fields, he\u0026rsquo;s trying to help them succeed. The scientific fields in question already have the right mission statements: scientific truth. He is aligned with that goal.\nFrege might feel that I am downplaying his primary achievement, which was to enlarge logic to the point where the natural numbers and laws of arithmetic were included directly in the logical layer. This was the subject of his later works The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) and Basic Laws of Arithmetic (part 1 in 1893, part 2 in 1903). Since the real numbers had been built up rigorously from the natural numbers by contemporaries such as Richard Dedekind, Frege would be connecting the whole edifice directly into logic. He felt this was a big missing piece:\nYet is it not shameful that a science should be so unclear about its most prominent object, which is apparently so simple?10\nHe spends many pages of these later works trying to define \u0026ldquo;concepts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;objects\u0026rdquo;, so that numbers can be given the status of real objects in a platonic sense. He captures his definition using something similar to set theory except that the atomic objects are extensions of concepts. Concepts in turn are propositional functions, that is functions that have the value True or False for any given object. The extension of the concept is then all the objects that yield the value True when plugged into the function. Then he defines 0 and 1 and a successor function, and can then use the concept script to prove theorems about arithmetic.\nThis part of his quest, subsuming arithmetic into logic, is not easy to assess. Most of it in The Foundations of Arithmetic takes the form of philosophical writing in human language, like any other philosophy paper, and so it\u0026rsquo;s doubtful he has an airtight case. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter so long as we allow ourselves to deal separately with the philosophical status of our foundations, and the inferences we make from those foundations. The successful portion of Frege\u0026rsquo;s work is the strategy of building a system of logic, and then somehow empowering ourselves to make airtight arguments starting from that system. Frege himself does just this in the subsequent Basic Laws of Arithmetic, wielding his concept script to prove the laws of arithmetic starting from his definition of the natural numbers.\nTying it all together we have these elements:\nScience and mathematics have value. They generate value in part because they are rigorous. Enhancing the rigor would enhance the power and the value of these activities. The enhancement can be brought about by expanding logic and by creating methods to effectively wield the logic: tools for people to perform gap-free inference. 2. Formalizing mathematics: carrying out Frege\u0026rsquo;s project The microscope that Frege invented is a logical system with a primitive notion of types. The type system consisted of \u0026ldquo;objects\u0026rdquo; at the lowest level, then functions of objects at level 1, then higher functions at the higher levels. His logical rules of inference are these nine (in modern notation):\n⊢ a → (b → a) ⊢ (c → (b → a)) → (c → b) → (c → a) ⊢ (d → (b → a)) → b → (d → a) ⊢ (b → a) → (¬a → ¬b) ⊢ ¬¬a → a ⊢ a → ¬¬a ⊢ (c ≣ d) → f(c) → f(d) ⊢ c ≣ c ⊢ ∀a.f(a) → f(c) Quite a lot of his specification is easily recognizable today, of course because we adopted it. His introduction of the universal quantifier, for example, (∀ in modern notation) was an original and impactful contribution. He was also careful about the use of bound and free variables in the concept script, and of the fact that the quantifiers need to have their scope specified. He also distinguished two kinds of equality to accompany his two levels of meaning, known as sense and reference. The sense of an expression is the exact meaning of the syntactic encoding (but isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as the syntactic encoding itself, which is a distinct third layer we can ignore here), and the reference is a semantic object to which the sense eventually refers, possibly after doing a lot of work to unpack the sense. His famous linguistic example is how \u0026ldquo;the morning star\u0026rdquo; has the same reference as \u0026ldquo;the evening star\u0026rdquo; since both are the planet Venus. But they differ at the level of sense, and they pick out the planet via different methods. Similarly, the equation \u0026ldquo;a = a\u0026rdquo; holds because the senses are syntactically the same, whereas \u0026ldquo;a + b = b + a\u0026rdquo; holds after a short proof, i.e. the senses differ but the references turn out to be the same. All of these ideas remain relevant today and we\u0026rsquo;ll return to them when we look at type theory.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just the logic that was prescient, but the concept script as well. Compare the concept script notation we saw earlier with, say, the heavy use of prose in most mathematics textbooks from the last 150 years. Most mathematicians are content with a lesser version of rigor, where arguments are made very carefully and as airtight as possible, but remain optimistically rooted in the intuition and incisiveness of the human operator. Frege did not think this was good enough:\nThe requirements on the rigour of proofs inevitably result in greater length. Anyone who does not bear this in mind will indeed be surprised at how long-winded the proof often is here of a proposition that he believes can be immediately grasped in a single act of understanding. This will be particularly striking if we compare Dedekind’s work Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?, the most thorough work on the foundation of arithmetic that has come to my attention in the last few years. In much less space it pursues the laws of arithmetic much further than is done here. This brevity is admittedly only achieved by not really proving much at all.11\nPatrick Massot, a prominent member of the Lean and Mathlib community, makes a convincing case12 that it is easy to overlook special cases such as the empty set when reasoning informally, but that Frege-style gap-free reasoning, of a kind that is literally being performed today with the help of computers, will catch these cases. This sort of completeness of argumentation is helpful, even crucial, and Frege deserves credit for focusing on this part of the challenge. Frege was clearly able to relate to the experience Massot is describing, where the formal system informs the operator that they must consider the case of the empty set:\none must write down all intermediate steps, to let the full light of consciousness fall upon them.13\nI\u0026rsquo;ll have more to say about computers and Mathlib shortly. But before I leave the subject of computers for now, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note something we do not see in Frege\u0026rsquo;s value system. There is a danger of conflating strictly computational activity, such as that performed by digital or human computers with mindless or degrading or even harmful jobs14. There is no evidence that Frege felt this way about a would-be operator of the concept script. We have just seen that he admitted the proofs would be long, but nowhere does he mention automation or machinery. He seems to have envisioned even the fully rigorous process as intended not only for people, but for mathematicians themselves.\n3. Disagreement with Hilbert I want to discuss something Frege knew about but wrongly rejected. It\u0026rsquo;s a little depressing that he missed out on it, because as we will see it\u0026rsquo;s the other piece of the modern point of view, and enabled the vindication of Frege\u0026rsquo;s logic and concept script in the end.\nIn 1899 Hilbert published Foundations of Geometry, which we recognize now as a major development. He proposed splitting mathematical theories, such as Euclidean geometry, into two parts. One part contains the axioms of the theory, including any conceptual objects which the theory will talk about and operate on. For geometry the objects are points, lines, line segments, circles, angles, and so on. The axioms could be, say, Euclid\u0026rsquo;s postulates (from Wolfram MathWorld15):\nA straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center. All right angles are congruent. Given any straight line and a point not on it, there exists one and only one straight line which passes\u0026quot; through that point and never intersects the first line, no matter how far they are extended. The second part of the theory is to take the axioms and interpret them in some specific mathematical setting. We could interpret all the objects (points, lines, etc.) in the usual Euclidean way in the plane, for example. But we could also work on a two-dimensional sphere and interpret \u0026ldquo;point\u0026rdquo; to mean \u0026ldquo;pair of antipodal points on the sphere\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;line\u0026rdquo; to mean \u0026ldquo;great circle\u0026rdquo;. We then get a second consistent theory except for postulate 5, which fails to hold because instead of having one such line, there are none.\nThere are at least three things going on here. First of all, it condenses geometry, both Euclidean and non-Euclidean, into a concise logical package. Secondly it empowers us to split our arguments into two parts. One part can focus on all the deductions we can make inside the system, simply based on the axioms, without referring to the interpretation. Some results require postulate 5 for their proof and these hold only in the planar interpretation. I like to think of the purely axiom-derived theorems as supplying strong answers to \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; questions. Why does some fact hold in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry? If we can prove it straight from the postulates, then it is because anything that obeys postulates 1-4 also obeys this rule. In a way the axiom systems together with deductions therefrom constitute a schema for a whole family of mathematical theorems.\nBut Hilbert\u0026rsquo;s method also gives us one more capability. We can directly ask whether the axioms are consistent, or the related question whether some of the axioms are independent of the rest. Since there are two interpretations of postulates 1-4 one of which obeys postulate 5 and one of which does not, we can conclude that postulate 5 does not follow from 1-4. That\u0026rsquo;s a result that took 2,000 years to discover. By moving back and forth between the axioms and some clever special models, we can conclude things just about the axioms. The independence of axiom 5 follows from an argument that uses a model. This is a standard trick today, which is why this was a major development.\nWhen I learned that Frege responded strongly against this idea of Hilbert\u0026rsquo;s, I was truly surprised. What were his objections? Frege wrote:\nNo man can serve two masters. One cannot serve both truth and untruth. If Euclidean geometry is true, then non-Euclidean geometry is false, and if non-Euclidean geometry is true, then Euclidean geometry is false.16\nIf one is content to have only phantoms hovering around one, there is no need to take the matter so seriously; but in science we are subject to the necessity of seeking after truth.17\nThe \u0026ldquo;phantoms\u0026rdquo; would presumably be the bare axiom system, devoid of interpretation.\nIt seems clear Frege is misunderstanding Hilbert, but I think we can learn some important lessons even from that. The misunderstanding is that Frege is unable to, or unaware that he should, merely postpone the interpretation of the axioms. The phantoms are temporary, and the process definitely has two steps. Frege insists in the first quote that the axioms must be true which entails that they also be fully interpreted. He and many other thinkers believed they were being invited to live only in axiom-space, proving empty results with no meaning. This was likened (pejoratively) to a game, and is given the name \u0026ldquo;formalism\u0026rdquo;. Hilbert retorted in 1919:\nWe are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.18\nI would argue that Frege is doing more than simply misunderstanding the proposal. He is defending mathematics from being drained of meaning. Hilbert is not of course draining it of meaning, but Frege thought he was and it bothered him. A geometrical point is a mathematical object and claims about it can be true or false, and such claims have value. An axiom is just a phantom, and has no value at all. This is very clarifying for us. If we consider Hilbert\u0026rsquo;s procedure a piece of new technology, Frege is like a luddite, worrying whether it will damage the field of mathematics.\nFrege must have believed this so fully that he did not take advantage of the synergy with his life\u0026rsquo;s work. The combination of axioms with logic allows an even larger portion of mathematical proofs to remain analytic, rigorous, and also general. The original theorems in planar geometry are fully recovered after performing interpretation, so nothing is lost but many new theorems are gained simultaneously, across all known and future interpretations.\nIn hindsight, Frege was trying to base his theory of natural numbers directly in platonic philosophical bedrock. He spent many pages arguing philosophically about concepts, functions, and extensions of functions, to lend credence that numbers are real objects. This is the realist part of his philosophy, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually not dependent on, or coupled to, the logical tools. We can preserve the logic and the value system, the quest for mathematical truth, and plug these into Hilbert\u0026rsquo;s axiomatic approach instead of into would-be real objects. In fact maybe we can even preserve the realism! Frege could have blessed certain interpretations of the axioms as \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; for example. But this counterfactual will not be of use to us here.\n4. Modern foundations: vindication of Frege\u0026rsquo;s logic 4.1. Synthesis of Frege and Hilbert Here is a very informal picture of modern mathematical foundations: mathematics is a graph structure (see picture below). It\u0026rsquo;s not a true formal graph, but the metaphor is so close to true that perhaps it could be made precise even without an explicit formalization like the ones we will discuss shortly. Each node is a theorem, and the edges (which are directed) represent the interdependency between the theorems. In other words, each node has a proof that makes use of the incoming edges. Maybe there are multiple proofs, each of which draws on a different subset of the edges. The source nodes, those with no incoming edges, are either axioms or definitions. The leaf nodes, with no outgoing edges, are results that are not yet used to prove something else. Some of these are at the frontier of research, and might be extended one day with outgoing edges to new results.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s fix our attention on some node, such as the theorem which states that the collection of smooth functions {f : M → ℝ | is_smooth(f)} forms an algebra under pointwise multiplication and addition, and multiplication by real numbers. Call this node \u0026ldquo;is_algebra(M → ℝ)\u0026rdquo;. Now light up all the nodes that lie on some path that flows into is_algebra(M → ℝ). If we are working in a foundation system like ZFC, then there are some ZFC axiom nodes, and also some definition nodes from various theories that we need (such as topology and calculus). From these there are edges that flow through a bunch of intermediate nodes (lemmas and other theorems) into is_algebra(M → ℝ). For example, somewhere there is a node that states that the pointwise product fg of two smooth functions f, g : M → ℝ is itself smooth. This will be needed to show that the algebra is closed under this operation.\nThis can all be formalized in a computer program (perhaps a proof assistant) that offers a system of logic together with the ZFC axioms. We then have some really valuable outputs: we have is_algebra(M → ℝ) itself, plus some documentation about the proof. But note that it\u0026rsquo;s relative to a few things:\nThe choice of ZFC as our foundations The choice of logical system The computer software, for example Metamath19 Hopefully the computer program doesn\u0026rsquo;t add very much on top of ZFC and the logical system, but it\u0026rsquo;s always possible there are bugs or other caveats hiding in there, so we\u0026rsquo;d better include it. We might be using a different proof assistant such as Lean, which uses a form of Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT) and which in general supports only constructive logic (though I hasten to add that you can add extra axioms that permit classical reasoning such as the law of excluded middle, in which case the results are simply applicable to fewer interpretations, in the Hilbert sense, of MLTT.)\nThis relativism is a part of the modern picture of mathematics that I want to highlight so we can compare it with Frege\u0026rsquo;s ideas. Mathematicians themselves explore the relativism inside of mathematics, by swapping in various axiom systems and various logical systems, and re-proving the theorems. Some mathematicians practice reverse mathematics20 which is a project to explore the entire graph I described, for example by discovering requirements for some given axiom system to support (flow to) some family of theorems. Software practitioners that use multiple computer software packages in fact must move between foundations, since with our current technology they are forced to reimplement theorems in each programming language separately, and those languages may also have different logics. There is a large body of Coq software, and a separate body of Lean software as well that covers an overlapping set of theorems, and similar bodies of software in other languages.\nFrege acknowledged that there may be imperfections in his logical axioms and inference rules. In fact he was made aware of a paradox by Bertrand Russell and tried to repair it. But he doesn\u0026rsquo;t indicate that we should entertain having more than one such system. It\u0026rsquo;s nearly certain that his views were incompatible with such a notion. As we saw, he tried in true realist fashion to ground his logic in philosophical bedrock, in order to increase the world\u0026rsquo;s total number of true, realist, complete logics from zero to one. His aversion to Hilbert\u0026rsquo;s rootless vision of axiom systems is another hint that there was room for only one version of the truth. We can\u0026rsquo;t rule out that he could have made room for multiple foundational vantage points, of course. Setting that difference aside, the narrative that begins after we select a foundation is very much compatible with Frege: we use the foundation to prove the same family of theorems, on the same quest for scientific truth, and establish them firmly and free of gaps.\n4.2. Type theory The particular foundation offered by Martin-Löf\u0026rsquo;s intuitionistic type theory2122 is especially noteworthy in this context, since it so perfectly incorporates the Hilbert picture into the foundations, while also capturing all three of Frege\u0026rsquo;s most important contributions that I am highlighting: logic, a system of types, and two kinds of equality. In intuitionistic type theory the types are \u0026ldquo;Hilbertian\u0026rdquo;, meaning they are abstract objects that are meant to eventually be interpreted into more concrete mathematical objects. And the interpretation process is completely formal and mathematical! For example if a mathematician has some objects of interest to which they wish to apply type theory (such as sets, or sheaves of sets over a topological space, or many other examples), they simply have to arrange for those objects to live inside a category with a few specific properties and the type theory will automatically be interpretable on these objects. Proofs expressed in type theory become proofs about those objects. Different versions of type theory with more or fewer features will require different features to be present in the category. That rather beautiful picture covers the Hilbert side of things.\nOn the Frege side, intuitionistic type theory has his notion of function objects and his distinction between free and bound variables, and the requirement that variables have types. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely more fleshed out and carefully thought through than what Frege gave us, but I believe it fulfills the very requirements that Frege set out.\nMiraculously, in type theory the logical framework is actually emergent from the type system! This is in some sense the greatest validation of Frege of all. Just by having function types, product types, coproduct types and so on, and assigning universal properties to these, we do not need to separately impose a logic. The behavior of the function types, for example, automatically establishes that B ∧ (B → A) → A. The behavior of the product types satisfies the rules of conjunction, and the coproduct types do the same for disjunction. Type theorists call this emergent logic \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; since it uses the material of the types to state and prove results. Whereas Frege\u0026rsquo;s goal was to absorb the natural numbers, and hence part of mathematics, into logic, the modern perspective is to couple them in the opposite way: it is logic that is emergent!\nFinally we come to Frege\u0026rsquo;s distinction between \u0026ldquo;a = a\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;a + b = b + a\u0026rdquo;, which he discusses in a few places including in On Sense and Reference (1892). He didn\u0026rsquo;t incorporate it directly into his logic or concept script, but he spent some time describing the distinction as a sort of metamathematical commentary. This has been the most recent and perhaps unexpected vindication of Frege\u0026rsquo;s priorities. Intuitionistic type theory indeed includes exactly the two kinds of equality Frege distinguished. One of them, dubbed \u0026ldquo;judgmental equality\u0026rdquo;, operates at the level of sense while the other, named \u0026ldquo;propositional equality\u0026rdquo;, which is a type, corresponds to reference. Having equality of sense gives you equality of reference automatically, but not vice versa. The exploration of these propositional equality types has led to the discovery of homotopy type theory and its infinite tower of equality types. Since equality is a type, there can be equalities between equalities and so on. This then turns out to generate an even more powerful theory for proving mathematical results.\n5. Proof assistants: vindication of Frege\u0026rsquo;s concept script Frege\u0026rsquo;s vision was for mathematicians to use logic and gap-free formal methods to strengthen the research they were already doing, i.e. the seeking of scientific truth. Nowhere is this goal more visibly realized than in the community projects that have grown up around various proof assistants. Two prominent examples are Mathematical Components23, which uses the Coq proof assistant, and Mathlib24 which uses the newer Lean proof assistant. There are mathematical communities around each of the other proof assistants as well, such as Isabelle, HOL Light, Agda, and so on. Some of these communities are growing quickly25, and I imagine new languages will come along every few years as well to stir the pot. The mathematical communities and their leadership are distinct from the teams that implement and support the proof assistant software. The goal is to formalize some body of mathematics, eventually all of it, using the proof assistant. The math libraries are therefore a combination of a software project and a mathematical project. We should equate the focus of these teams on the mathematical content itself, and not just the tools, with an alignment with Frege\u0026rsquo;s vision of the concept script as a mere microscope.\nThere are diverse public statements by mathematicians such as Vladimir Voevodsky, recipient of a Fields Medal in 2002, who expressed worry in 2015 about the scale of the mathematical literature and how this undermines the certainty of new results26:\n\u0026ldquo;The world of mathematics is becoming very large, the complexity of mathematics is becoming very high, and there is a danger of an accumulation of mistakes,\u0026rdquo; Voevodsky said.\n[\u0026hellip;]In 1999 he discovered an error in a paper he had written seven years earlier.\nKevin Buzzard frames this same problem as a crisis of rigor27:\nBuzzard believes that these kinds of problems [mistakes and unpublished proofs] undermine pure maths to such an extent that it\u0026rsquo;s slid into a crisis.\nAnd Peter Scholze, recipient of a Fields Medal in 2018, explains how the formalization project he led went very smoothly, and also made a profound contribution to his understanding of the theory itself28:\nI am excited to announce that the Experiment has verified the entire part of the argument that I was unsure about. I find it absolutely insane that interactive proof assistants are now at the level that within a very reasonable time span they can formally verify difficult original research. Congratulations to everyone involved in the formalization!!\nWhat else did you learn?\nAnswer: What actually makes the proof work! When I wrote the blog post half a year ago, I did not understand why the argument worked, and why we had to move from the reals to a certain ring of arithmetic Laurent series. But during the formalization, a significant amount of convex geometry had to be formalized (in order to prove a well-known lemma known as Gordan’s lemma), and this made me realize that actually the key thing happening is a reduction from a non-convex problem over the reals to a convex problem over the integers.\nAll of these scientists developed a positive view towards the formalization of mathematics mid-career. The common reason is that they all wanted to keep doing mathematics successfully. They wanted to do the same work as before, but with more certainty. This is exactly what Frege was proposing. But on top of that, Scholze in particular articulated the additional benefit Frege highlighted, that when formalizing math \u0026ldquo;one must write down all intermediate steps, to let the full light of consciousness fall upon them\u0026rdquo;. The computer mediated the additional shared understanding of actual mathematics, by structuring the work required to build the theory, and by forbidding gaps.\nIt will help to tease out what parts of the mathematical agenda the computer is currently helping with, because then we can spot the area where the actual crisis has begun. To study this I used the Lean proof assistant myself. I proved the proposition we discussed above, is_algebra(M → ℝ)29. Lean has a small \u0026ldquo;trusted kernel\u0026rdquo; where the core logic is implemented, and this corresponds to Frege\u0026rsquo;s logic, albeit expanded into the more powerful logic of intuitionistic type theory. In addition to the kernel, the language allows proofs to be built up incrementally with tactics that advance the state of the proof by applying various transformations and lemmas. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s more intuitive to apply a tactic to the chain of steps that started with the assumptions, and sometimes you want to apply a tactic to transform the chain that leads to the goal. Eventually they will meet in the middle and form an unbroken chain. The software permits you to focus on one step at a time. It also enables you to designate one step as a possibly large sub-problem, which becomes the current lemma to prove. What the computer is offering among other things is a set of affordances to support a linear ordering of the work.\nI browsed the library of theorems about smooth and topological manifolds, and the library of definitions around vector spaces, rings, and algebras. I saw how to create an algebra out of a carrier object plus some operations, plus proofs that the carrier object was closed under those operations. I will call this the \u0026ldquo;proof strategy\u0026rdquo;. Then I performed the work to enter all this data into my own source file. At any given moment I could choose a place to add a step to the proof, at which point I had to type something! Knowing what to type after you choose a location is a tough sub-problem that I want to highlight. In summary, to formalize a proof you must:\nFormalize all the definitions. Plan the strategy, i.e. the method of proof. In my case the strategy was to prove that the collection of smooth real-valued functions satisfied each of the half-dozen requirements to be an algebra. Perform many iterations of the small-scale tactical piece: select a rule or lemma from the library, and apply it somewhere on the frontier of the proof. Choose an order to perform the actions in 3. The community manages the storage of definitions and existing theorems in the digital library (such as the Mathlib Github repository), which helps with 1. The mathematical content exists mainly in 2. Often an existing known proof is what you need to formalize, but in other situations you might have reason to prove the result with a different method in order to fit the logic being used. For example, some type theories do not offer classical logic such as the law of the excluded middle, requiring constructive proofs. Often these are not available in the literature. The computer helps with 3 and 4, and I want to come back and focus on 3 in a moment.\nLean\u0026rsquo;s tactics engine is one way to support 4. The whole paradigm of tactics is that you build up the proof from small commands. But other systems like Agda lack this explicitly incremental paradigm. Instead they offer interactive tools to probe the state of the proof, or leave figurative holes to come back to later. These contortions that the user went to are not saved with the file, however.\nSo what about 3? If you are in the middle of a proof, and you believe that elsewhere in the library is a lemma that the pointwise product of two smooth functions is smooth, how do you find it so that you can type its name? What if you don\u0026rsquo;t know whether that lemma is available or not? This portion of the task is not apparent in Frege\u0026rsquo;s description but turns out to dominate the work. This is also the least mathematical part of the process! And it is here where mathematicians began to envision a role for artificial intelligence. What if I was in the middle of this proof and I could ask the proof assistant to search for an appropriate lemma? It could use any combination of brute-force search through all the definitions in the library, or some naming hints, or even some patterns learned from a database of example proofs. All of these approaches are taken by a diverse collection of tactics. The most general-purpose tools are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;hammers\u0026rdquo; because of the name of an early paradigmatic example. The community is eager for new hammers to help with such searches. One recent example in Coq was worthy of publication30. The expertise required is quite orthogonal to the subject matter of smooth manifolds, and so it makes sense for a different sort of specialist to help tackle it.\nBut it turns out there is a bit of a trap here. We converted a mathematical problem that used to be tackled with pencil and paper into a semi-computerized process. One part of that process, the finding of lemmas, is a problem entirely created by the computerization! It turns out to be hard for people to convert back into a human-solvable problem. And so now we have phoned our friends in the AI department to help us solve it. Might an AI researcher look at formalized math and wonder if the computer can do all of it, and do it better than people?\n6. The privilege to do math For fear of obfuscating what I want to say about today\u0026rsquo;s crisis let me start by simply stating it: I think limiting the definition of \u0026ldquo;doers of mathematics\u0026rdquo; to people as soon as possible would be a healthy step. I think we should close ranks to defend this position because it is being attacked under the cloak of AI research. But I also think that computers are amazing tools and I have devoted my own career to making them smarter. Many mathematicians have the same positive view of computers, especially those in the formalization community that I have described. This makes it seem that I am trying to split hairs, and I worry that this appearance will make it even more difficult to mount a humanist defense against AI. My goal for the rest of this section is to convince you that:\nSome prominent AI researchers want to redefine mathematics to include computers as the doers, in the way others have done for the playing of chess and Go. Some mathematicians want to yield to this. Frege offers a vision for compartmentalizing the use of computers in math. 6.1. Quanta\u0026rsquo;s muddled report In the 2020 Quanta Magazine article \u0026ldquo;How Close are Computers to Automating Mathematical Reasoning\u0026rdquo;31 we get a good status report on the redefinition of mathematics as non-human. Several researchers are quoted in the article, but their viewpoints do not gel into a single coherent narrative. The picture becomes much clearer if we examine each quote and ask \u0026ldquo;is this person focused on helping people do math, or helping computers do it?\u0026rdquo;\nMichael Harris (a mathematician) wants people such as himself to do math and he worries that a proof assistant would make it harder: \u0026ldquo;By the time I’ve reframed my question into a form that could fit into this technology, I would have solved the problem myself.\u0026rdquo;\nKevin Buzzard (the mathematician and evangelist for formalizing mathematics we met earlier) wants computers to be mathematicians and claims that mainstream mathematicians want the same: \u0026ldquo;Computers have done amazing calculations for us, but they have never solved a hard problem on their own,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Until they do, mathematicians aren’t going to be buying into this stuff.\u0026rdquo; I want to especially note the circular salesmanship in this sentiment: we want computers to get better at doing math because we want to sell the project to mathematicians, presumably so that computers can continue to do more math for them.\nEmily Riehl wants to learn to do math with a proof assistant and wants her students to learn too: \u0026ldquo;It’s not necessarily something you have to use all the time, and will never substitute for scribbling on a piece of paper,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;but using a proof assistant has changed the way I think about writing proofs.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo computer scientists, Christian Szegedy (at Google) and Josef Urban (at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics) want to teach computers to do math without any human involvement:\nUrban was partially inspired by Andrej Karpathy, who a few years ago trained a neural network to generate mathematical-looking nonsense that looked legitimate to non-experts. Urban didn’t want nonsense, though — he and his group instead designed their own tool to find new proofs after training on millions of theorems. Then they used the network to generate new conjectures and checked the validity of those conjectures using an ATP[automatic theorem prover] called E.\nThe network proposed more than 50,000 new formulas, though tens of thousands were duplicates. \u0026ldquo;It seems that we are not yet capable of proving the more interesting conjectures,\u0026rdquo; Urban said.\n[Szegedy\u0026rsquo;s] group at Google Research recently described a way to use language models — which often use neural networks — to generate new proofs. After training the model to recognize a kind of treelike structure in theorems that are known to be true, they ran a kind of free-form experiment, simply asking the network to generate and prove a theorem without any further guidance. Of the thousands of generated conjectures, about 13% were both provable and new (meaning they didn’t duplicate other theorems in the database). The experiment, he said, suggests that the neural net could teach itself a kind of understanding of what a proof looks like.\n\u0026ldquo;Neural networks are able to develop an artificial style of intuition,\u0026rdquo; Szegedy said.\nWe will come back to Szegedy and the idea of computers generating theorems shortly. Note however that these researchers are not extending proof assistants with hammers and the like. Instead they are digesting the existing human-crafted proofs and treating them as raw data to train neural networks that are similar to those that perform other text-based tasks such as translating text or performing automatic summarizations.\nGetting back to the article, Timothy Gowers (a mathematician) says computers will literally replace mathematicians (without saying whether he thinks this is good):\nmathematicians will enjoy a kind of golden age, \u0026ldquo;when mathematicians do all the fun parts and computers do all the boring parts. But I think it will last a very short time.\u0026rdquo;\nMichael Harris has some pushback on this: \u0026ldquo;Even if computers understand, they don’t understand in a human way.\u0026rdquo;\n6.2. Only people have meaning Szegedy\u0026rsquo;s confusion can be traced in a way to a misreading of Frege. Here is Szegedy\u0026rsquo;s definition of mathematics:\nMathematics is the discipline of pure reasoning. Mathematical reasoning is not about mathematics per se, it is about reasoning in general.\nThis is taken from Szegedy\u0026rsquo;s 2020 article32 as cited by Harris33, who grapples in his public writing with the uses of AI in mathematics. Szegedy\u0026rsquo;s position erases literally everything that has value. Think again of Frege\u0026rsquo;s separation: there is logic, and there is mathematics. Logic and the concept script are methods for making airtight arguments while doing mathematics. Szegedy is taking the \u0026ldquo;doing mathematics\u0026rdquo; part and folding it back into the logic. There is only logic for Szegedy \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;reasoning in general\u0026rdquo;. And so if the computer can learn to emit deductions automatically with a method that draws on human examples, then the computer is doing mathematics. After all, mathematics is not about mathematics per se!\nI simply do not believe that the bare theorems themselves, or their proofs, carry any intrinsic value or meaning. After all, they are analytically entailed by the starting material, i.e. the definitions, axioms, and rules of logic. They do not themselves carry any information beyond that. There is a large space of facts that are entailed by these same starting conditions, and every point in this space carries, by itself, merely that information. Only by selecting one such result for a moment, for some reason, can we make one of them special and carry additional meaning. Meaning for us is inside us, tautologically. Therefore automatically enumerating theorems can add no meaning.\nIs a computer playing chess when a user interacts with chess software? Only if the computer is also playing chess when it is playing both sides of the game by itself, like when training AlphaZero34. The only meaning of such a game stems from the fact that there are some people who set the computer to that task. The people behind the game, and their motives, have meaning, but the game does not stand by itself as a meaningful act. I can easily grant such a game a meaning, by a conscious act! But if I don\u0026rsquo;t, then nothing happens. The game cannot insist, it is not a source node for meaning.\nSo where is the idea coming from that the computer is indeed playing chess? I propose that the programmers of the computer are asking us to grant it that, as they have. Who benefits if we agree, and who suffers a negative consequence? And who benefits if we disagree? I\u0026rsquo;m insisting that we focus only on people, so we should focus on people when we try to figure out why we\u0026rsquo;re being asked to call the computer a person.\nLet me say this one final way. When Szegedy\u0026rsquo;s team\u0026rsquo;s computer emits some theorems, how will they evaluate the results? How long will they stare at the meaningless (to them) output before they copy and paste it into an email to a mathematician? They will have to bring these theorems to human mathematicians to interpret them and evaluate them. There is no other notion of interpretation. There is no audience besides the audience of mathematicians. When a willing mathematician identifies some such result as interesting and tells Nature magazine about it35, that person will perhaps transfer some of the fame of mathematics onto the programmers and their computer. The whole process conserves the value the mathematician was already bringing.\nAnd when these programmers need to build their AI, how will they do it? We know how because it has already been done. The programmers will copy the data files from a public repository of HOL Light, Coq or Lean proofs, and encode them as training examples for the computer. Again, the computer can only perform analytic trivialities, and so mathematicians need to both create the input and evaluate the output.\nWill mathematicians cooperate? Should they? What could we even do? My only suggestion at the moment is to choose a restricted license file to attach to the source code repositories of Mathlib and the other libraries. Currently Mathlib uses the Apache 2.0 license, which is a very permissive license in common use. It even allows commercial uses.\nWhat will happen in five years after ten very hard problems are solved through a collaboration with AI? Who will explain to society that the humans are still doing all the meaning-making? And when we try to explain, will the programmers cooperate?\n6.3. Good uses of computers So what then are some value-enhancing uses of computers? Frege showed us one: use computers to implement the concept script, to help formalize mathematics. Inside the formalization software are additional affordances such as tactics, which constitute entirely new use cases for the computer that also help us bring meaning into the world.\nOther promising use cases are being invented daily. One family of ideas is to make better search engines for mathematical literature, or for specific theorems. MathFoldr36 aims to use wikis such as the nLab37 as data sets to learn how to add metadata to mathematical texts, enhancing search indexes. Their stated goal is suitably humanistic: \u0026ldquo;MathFoldr will provide search and literature curation tools that will make mathematics more accessible, with the ultimate goal of transforming the way mathematics is created and navigated\u0026rdquo;.\nFAbstracts38 aims to build a digital library of formalized mathematics, including the statements of not-yet-formalized results. But their vision statement is as muddled as the Quanta article, having as goals both the worrisome \u0026ldquo;machine learning in math\u0026rdquo; as well as the more human-centered \u0026ldquo;tools for exploration such as a Google Earth for mathematics, providing an intuitive visual map of the entire world of mathematics\u0026rdquo;.\nThe mathematician William Thurston said \u0026ldquo;Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms: it is about understanding.\u0026rdquo;39. Doing mathematics makes changes to us, to our minds. Proving theorems with a computer brings a strikingly similar experience to proving them on paper. That is because the meaning of the act is the same.\nReferences Frege, Gottlob, Begriffsschrift, p. iii, from The Frege Reader, Micheal Beaney (ed.), Blackwell 1997\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. iv\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. 8\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nRead more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_of_opposition\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nBegriffsschrift, p. 24\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. iii\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. iv\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. 3\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. vi\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFrege, Gottlob, Foundations of Arithmetic, p. ii, from The Frege Reader, Micheal Beaney (ed.), Blackwell 1997\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFrege, Gottlob, Basic Laws of Arithmetic, p. vii, from The Frege Reader, Micheal Beaney (ed.), Blackwell 1997\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/files/exposition/why_formalize.pdf\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nBasic Laws of Arithmetic, p. viii\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDaston, Lorraine. \u0026ldquo;Calculation and the Division of Labor, 1750-1950.\u0026rdquo; Bulletin of the German Historical Institute 62.Spring (2018): 9-30.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://mathworld.wolfram.com/ParallelPostulate.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nOn Euclidean Geometry, p. 183, from The Frege Reader, Micheal Beaney (ed.), Blackwell 1997\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nibid., p. 184\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert#cite_note-44\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMegill, Norman D. and Wheeler, David A.

When you tie one hand behind your back (such as avoiding the use of the existence of points, the axiom of choice, and/or the law of the excluded middle) then the constructions and proofs you invent can be more illuminating and deeper than before. I want to convince you that this may be true for algorithmic randomness notions. In [7], Alex Simpson has formulated a measure theory for locales and provided a new definition of randomness in this setting. I will describe this work, emphasizing the point-free interpretation.\nRandom real numbers satisfy the following hand-waving characterizations.\nThey cannot be obtained constructively.\nThey obey almost-everywhere properties.\nThey appear tied to the foundations of mathematics.\nFor a survey of these and other properties, see Rute [6]. I will argue that defining random points in terms of locales is well suited to capturing or even explaining all three of these properties. First of all, locales provide a setting for topology that supports constructive arguments, and randomness is in some sense the opposite of constructivity. Secondly, locales provide a model of topological spaces and continuous functions, so we can connect with classical results in analysis including almost-everywhere theorems like Lebesgue's theorem. And thirdly locales mediate a generalization from set theory to topos theory and type theory, modern constructive settings where mathematical foundations are being explored. Constructions like the effective topos and assemblies capture computability in this general context. It seems inevitable that randomness will find enhanced definitions in these new foundations.\n1.1 Randomness vs determinism: a confused debate In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article on Chance and Randomness [1], section 5.2 (”Chaotic Dynamics”), the authors describe an iterated transformation on the unit square, somewhat analogous to repeatedly folding dough. Given a starting point (p,q),0≤p,q≤1, define a function ϕ⁢(p,q)={(2⁢p,q/2),if ⁢0≤p≤12(2⁢p-1,(1+q)/2),if ⁢12≤p≤1 As the authors say, “This corresponds to transforming the unit square to a rectangle twice as wide and half the height, chopping off the right half, and stacking it back on top to fill the unit square again.” So, needlessly more violent than folding, but close. If we represent p and q in their binary expansion, we have\nϕ(0.p1p2…,0.q1q2…)=(0.p2p3…,0.p1q1q2…). In the article this example is intended to convey a paradox. On the one hand, the system is ergodic and behaves like a random process. Points will wander throughout the space without any pattern. But on the other hand the system is deterministic. The bit shift formula shows how it works: this is an engine that uses the next bit of the binary expansion to determine where the point moves next.\nThe resolution of the paradox, I believe, is to worry more about whether you can get your hands on p and q in the first place. Sure, once you have them, the machine behaves deterministically. But you can't have them! They require an infinite amount of information to specify, and to have one is to provide its entire future path through the process. The problem with the paradox is therefore in one of its assumptions. The process is deterministic, but the randomness is in the input data.\nIndeed, the most important property of random numbers appears to be their infinite nature, which prevents us from ever having one fully specified for us, either in a machine, in our minds, or in our theories. They are not computable, and they are not constructible.\nConfusingly, there are several different definitions of algorithmic randomness. In fact there is a whole family (or if you're in a teasing mood, a zoo) of them. They go by names such as Martin-Löf randomness, Schnorr randomness, weak-n-randomness, and computable randomness. They are not equivalent but they form a simple chain of inclusions, and smart people have worked out that the differences can be explained and parameterized by a family of choices that relate them. What I will present here is a consideration that is orthogonal to the flavor of randomness, namely the packaging of the random numbers inside the reals. The main ingredient is a shift from set theory to locale theory. A locale is a generalization of a topological space, and I will argue that it is very well suited to a philosophical interpretation of randomness.\n2 Frames and Locales Locale theory is point-free topology. See Johnstone [2] for an accessible survey, or Chapter IX of Mac Lane and Moerdijk [5] for a pleasantly breezy but more thorough introduction, or Johnstone [3] chapter C1 for a detailed treatment. We can also call it synthetic topology in that it takes open sets as basic, undefined objects, instead of defining them as collections of points. Instead it is points that will become a derived concept. Topological spaces with their actual open sets of actual points provide examples of locales, but there are more general ones as well. This will give us a new point of view on randomness.\nA locale is a frame. A frame is a partially ordered set (poset) with finite meets ∧ and arbitrary joins ∨, with a maximal element ⊤ and minimal element ⊥, and where the infinite distributive law holds:\nx∧(⋁iyi)=⋁i(x∧yi). This definition is clearly abstracted from the axioms for a topology: we are to imagine the elements of the poset are open sets of a generalized space. If we require only countable joins then it is called a σ-frame. The open sets of a topological space form a frame (or a σ-frame). A frame map is a function that preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins. A σ-frame map preserves countable joins. We collect this data into the category 𝖥𝗋𝗆 of frames and σ⁢𝖥𝗋𝗆 of σ-frames.\nA continuous map between topological spaces induces a frame map on the frames of open sets, but in the opposite direction because the inverse image of an open is open. This motivates the definition of the category 𝖫𝗈𝖼 of locales to be simply 𝖥𝗋𝗆𝗈𝗉 and σ⁢𝖫𝗈𝖼=σ⁢𝖥𝗋𝗆𝗈𝗉. (Recall that the opposite of a category is a category with all the same objects and morphisms, but with the direction of all the morphism arrows reversed.) We can define a functor L:𝖳𝗈𝗉→𝖫𝗈𝖼 on objects by mapping a space X to its frame of open sets 𝒪⁢(X) (so on objects, L=𝒪), and on morphisms by mapping a function f:X→Y to the opposite arrow of the induced morphism on frames, so that's two inversions giving us an arrow L⁢(f):L⁢(X)→L⁢(Y).\nWe'll use notation like X,Y,… to denote locales, and 𝒪⁢(X),𝒪⁢(Y),… to denote frames of open sets. 3 Points Consider the topological space ⋆ consisting of a single point. Its topology is just the poset {⊥≤⊤} (the empty set and the whole space). To treat points as a derived concept, note that a point in a space X is equivalent to a map pt:⋆→X, which at the level of frames is a map 𝒪⁢(X)→{⊤,⊥}. The inverse image of ⊤ is the collection of all open sets that contain the point pt⁢(⋆). This forms what is known as a completely prime filter in the frame, which is a collection P of opens such that if x∨y∈P then x∈P or y∈P. (This is analogous to a prime ideal, or the ideal generated by a prime number.) We can then move forward with locales and completely prime filters instead of spaces and points!\nNote how compatible this is with a constructive point of view. To supply a point you must supply a function ⋆→X. The points aren't given, you have to do work to produce one.\nGiven a locale X, the set of completely prime filters constitutes the spatial part of X, and this set inherits a topology from the structure of X. Locale maps preserve prime filters so we obtain a set function between the spatial parts of the locales. We can package this as a functor S:𝖫𝗈𝖼→𝖳𝗈𝗉 which turns out to be right adjoint to L. If we go back and forth with S∘L, starting from an honest topological space, then we get back an equivalent space with an equivalent topology so long as the original space is sober, which is a definition that is almost circularly defined to meet this condition. Hausdorff spaces are sober. (The mathematicians who developed locale theory were very self-conscious about the names according to Peter Johnstone in [4] and it shows — they chose great names like “sober.”)\nWe won't make use of S, but it's important to know about it to have a global picture of how spaces are embedded in the larger category of locales.\n4 Sublocales Mathematicians have been careful to choose the correct notion of subspace in this context: the sublocale. There are three equivalent ways to define sublocales. Normally I'd expect two since we are bouncing between two opposite categories. But there is a super interesting third definition as well, and the interplay of all three sheds light on the application to randomness.\n4.1 Definition 1: Embedded subspaces To me the most intuitive definition is the one that lets us think of a sublocale as being like an embedded subspace, i.e. a monomorphic map with the extra requirement that the subspace is embedded. In the category of topological spaces this means the domain is homeomorphic to its image. For example, for a map from [0,1] into a space X to be an embedding the curve must not self-intersect or do anything pathological. In categorical terms embeddings and sublocales are regular monomorphisms and these have special factorization properties. You can maybe already tell that this is a less permissive notion of subspace than subspaces in 𝖳𝗈𝗉, where any old subset of a topological space (i.e. any monomorphism) can be equipped with the subspace topology and considered a subobject.\n4.2 Definition 2: Quotients of frames In the category of frames the arrows are reversed and so a sublocale is in fact a quotient frame, i.e. an equivalence relation. Intuitively, two open sets are equivalent if they agree on the sublocale. Precisely, a sublocale =Y is an equivalence relation that preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins:\nU=YV⁢and⁢U′=YV′ ⟹ U∧U′=YV∧V′ Ui=YVi⁢for⁢all⁢i≥0 ⟹ ⋁i≥0Ui=Y⋁i≥0Vi. 4.3 Definition 3: Nuclei The nucleus definition of a sublocale also takes place in the category of frames. It is just the surjective map corresponding to the quotient. A nucleus is a function j:𝒪⁢(X)→𝒪⁢(X) satisfying\nU ≤j⁢U j⁢j⁢U =j⁢U j⁢(U∧V) =j⁢(U)∧j⁢(V) The intuition is that j takes an open set to some largest version of itself satisfying some property, which is why the first condition has the containment, and why the second condition is idempotence – doing the operation twice yields the same largest open. The third condition is that forming the “largest version” preserves finite intersection.\nDenote the fixed points of j (i.e. the collection of largest sets) by 𝒪j⁢(X) and denote the dual object by Xj. Then Xj is the sublocale. The map j is a surjective frame map onto the set of fixed points, and so gives an embedding i:Xj↪X. This is basically performing the quotient from the previous definition, mapping every open onto the largest representative in the equivalence class.\n4.4 The collection of all sublocales The collection of all sublocales of a fixed locale X is partially ordered by inclusion, just as we have in any category where we can define subobjects. It's worth mentioning that even more is true: the collection of sublocales forms a coframe, which is dual to a frame, so is a poset with finite joins and arbitrary meets, and where the joins distribute over the meets. This collection is nowhere near as straightforward to contemplate as the collection of subsets of a set, but we will keep thinking through some of the consequences to find how it connects with randomness.\n4.5 A pointless sublocale We're ready to define a sublocale with no points! Let X be a Hausdorff topological space without isolated points and let 𝒪⁢(X) be the frame of its open sets. Consider the double-negation operation ¬⁢¬:𝒪⁢(X)→𝒪⁢(X). What does this do? The negation of an open U is the largest open disjoint from U (or equivalently, the union of all opens disjoint from U). In an actual space such as X this is the same as the interior of the complement, but in a locale we don't have complements since they are not open. Repeating the operation, ¬⁢¬⁢U is thus the largest open disjoint from the largest open disjoint from U. For a lot of sets this is just U again but sometimes it erases information. For any p∈X we have that ¬⁢¬⁡(X-{p})=X, because ¬⁡(X-{p})=∅. So this operation blurs out the points.\n¬⁢¬ is idempotent, and in fact defines a nucleus hence an embedding n⁢n:X¬⁢¬↪X, where n⁢n-1⁢U=¬⁢¬⁢U. It's this sublocale X¬⁢¬ that has no points. For suppose p:⋆→X¬⁢¬ is a point. The composition n⁢n∘p is thus a point of X. Consider the open set given by deleting this point from X, i.e. X-{n⁢n⁢(p⁢(⋆))}. Taking the inverse image in frames we have p-1⁢(¬⁢¬⁡(X-{n⁢n⁢(p⁢(⋆))}))=⊥ because only opens that contain the image of ⋆ map back to ⊤. But as we saw in the previous paragraph ¬⁢¬⁡(X-{n⁢n⁢(p⁢(⋆))})=X, so the above expression p-1(¬¬(X-{nn(p(⋆))}) becomes p-1⁢(X) which is ⊤, a contradiction! You can't have points if you blurred away the points.\nFurthermore, X¬⁢¬ is dense in X. For a sublocale A↪X to be dense means that A intersects every open sublocale. (An open sublocale is one of the original open sets in X, promoted to a sublocale by embedding it in X.) This follows from being a nucleus: ¬⁢¬⁢A⊇A. The definitions are piling up, aren't they?\n4.6 Locale morphisms A fact that makes the category of locales different from the category of spaces is that any two dense sublocales intersect to form another dense sublocale! If we intersect all dense sublocales we form a smallest dense sublocale of any locale X and it turns out to be exactly X¬⁢¬. By smallest I mean inside the poset of sublocales. None of this is the case with topological spaces such as ℝ which can be decomposed into disjoint dense subsets such as ℚ and ℝ\\ℚ. This is confusing! What does the sublocale ℚ↪ℝ look like then? The consequences for measure theory are significant, since defining measures on sets leads to some pathological examples involving cosets of the rationals.\nLet's look at the image of a sublocale inclusion. For this we need the “push-forward” map f*:𝒪⁢(X)→𝒪⁢(Y), which is actually right adjoint to the inverse image map f-1:𝒪⁢(Y)→𝒪⁢(X). It is defined as follows:\nf*⁢(U)=⋃f-1⁢(V)⊆UV. In other words, an open set U⊆X maps under f* to the largest open set in Y that pulls back to some subset of U.\nThis is an elementary operation but not one that comes up in a standard undergraduate topology course (at least a 20th century one!). Here's an example that may help: imagine f:[0,1]→ℝ2 is some smooth curve in the plane. Given an open interval (a,b)⊆[0,1], its image in the plane is a one-dimensional subset, so won't itself be open. Instead to compute f*⁢((a,b)) we have to find the largest open set in the plane whose inverse image is (a,b), which will look like all of ℝ2 minus two skinny pieces of the curve that are the images of [0,a] and [b,1]. So it has the image in it, plus all the rest of the plane that isn't in the image of the rest of [0,1].\nThe requirement that f* give the largest open set such that some condition holds should remind us of a nucleus. In fact given a sublocale f:X→Y then f*∘f-1 is the nucleus for the sublocale! It maps an open set to the direct image of its inverse image, which will be the largest open that contains the one you started with, and which itself also maps back to the same open in X.\nNow let's get back to considering the inclusion i:ℚ↪ℝ. The push-forward map i* sends the open set “all of ℚ” in ℚ to the largest open in ℝ whose inverse image is contained in ℚ. But ℚ is dense so this is all of ℝ! There's no smaller open that contains the rationals! The requirement that this push-forward be an open set is forbidding us from carving out these pathological dense subsets in the category of locales. The topological glue of the real numbers is constraining what kind of subobjects we have access to.\n5 Measure theory We have prepared all the abstract background. We have a new setting for topology called locale theory, which has broken away from the concept of a point. We have seen that the monomorphisms are different than in the category of topological spaces, and we have examples of sublocales that have no points. Let's bring measure theory into the mix and define randomness in this setting.\nTechnically we are back to requiring the “σ-” on the words “frame”, “locale” and “sublocale” so that we can reconnect with the countability requirements of measures. On the other hand many spaces we care about are “strongly Lindelöf” and we can drop the σ-. Simpson works out the details in [7]. To be strongly Lindelöf means that for any collection of open sets, their union is contained in a countable union of open sets. This includes ℝ. For the rest of the essay we'll assume we are dealing with strongly Lindelöf spaces and we'll drop the σ-, but of course the full theory can be more general if we want.\nWe will define a measure on a locale/frame and then extend it to all the sublocales of the frame.\nA measure on a frame is a function μ:F→[0,∞] satisfying\nμ⁢(⊥)=0 x≤y⟹μ⁢(x)≤μ⁢(y) μ⁢(x)+μ⁢(y)=μ⁢(x∨y)+μ⁢(x∧y) (\"⁢modularity⁢\") (xi)i≥0⁢ascending⟹μ⁢(⋁i≥0xi)=supi≥0⁡μ⁢(xi) (\"⁢continuity⁢\"). We say μ is a probability measure if μ⁢(⊤)=1. We will also call μ a measure on a locale if it is a measure on the corresponding frame of opens.\nTo bring the concept of measure to sublocales we will generalize the concept of outer measure. We say a locale is fitted if for every sublocale Y⊆X it holds that Y=⋀𝒩⁢(Y) where 𝒩⁢(Y)={U∈𝒪⁢(X)|Y⊆U}, the family of opens containing Y. We extend the measure μ to a measure μ* on any sublocale by μ*⁢(Y)=infU∈𝒩⁢(Y)⁡μ⁢(U), i.e. the limit of the measure of the open sets that intersect to Y. There is work to show that spaces we care about are fitted, and that this definition really defines a measure (see section 5 of [7]).\nWe can now cash in the fact that we cannot decompose locales into two dense sublocales. Simpson [7] proves in Example 4.7 that the standard measure on open subsets of ℝn, which extends to a measure on sublocales in the way we just defined, is preserved under Euclidean translations. This measure agrees with Lebesgue measure whenever the sublocale agrees with a measurable set. In standard measure theory there is no translation invariant measure on arbitrary subsets of ℝn due to pathological examples like cosets of rational numbers, which of course are automatically avoided in locale theory.\n5.1 The random sublocale We are ready to define the random sublocale RanX of an arbitrary locale X equipped with a probability measure μ. We'll do it three times, once for each definition of sublocale.\nThe spatial definition of RanX is the smallest sublocale of measure 1, or equivalently the intersection of all sublocales of measure 1. This tracks exactly with the definition of Kurtz randomness seen in the algorithmic randomness literature. It's morally similar to X¬⁢¬ but making use of measure. X¬⁢¬ is the smallest dense sublocale of X, whereas RanX is the smallest measure-1 sublocale.\nThe quotient definition of RanX is the equivalence relation =RanX given by U=RanXV⇔μ⁢(U)=μ⁢(U∩V)=μ⁢(V). Opens are equivalent if they cover the same piece of space with equal measure.\nThe nucleus definition is not mentioned by Simpson, but obviously it's given by jRanX⁢(U)=⋃V⊇U,μ⁢(U)=μ⁢(V)V. In other words, it maps U to the maximal open that contains U and has the same measure as U.\nThis sublocale has no points! Given a point p∈X, the set X-{p} has measure 1 and so RanX⊆X-{p} and so p is not present in the random sublocale. Equating sets blurs away the points like ¬⁢¬ does.\n6 Conclusion: open sets vs randomness Topology is about open sets, and open sets correspond to semideciadable properties, i.e. properties that can be verified in finite time, but might need infinite time to refute. This is philosophically adjacent to being computable and constructive. In the Cantor space of binary sequences, the open sets are unions of cylinders, which are finite prefixes of sequences. We can verify propositions about infinite sequences just when we can do it in finite time. The finiteness is the openness and vice versa.\nLocales take just the open sets from topology and build from there, without allowing us to have points unless we can construct them.\nWe've seen that locales behave very differently! There have smallest dense subsets so you can't decompose the reals into a disjoint union of rational and irrational. The topological glue constrains you from doing this.\nMeasure theory can be done on locales and it avoids some pathological problems that set theory causes. And we can form a smallest full-measure sublocale, “random sublocale.” This sublocale has no points.\nSo if we revisit our set theoretic foundations and consider open sets to be primary, then we arrive at a definition of randomness where the randoms constitute a space with full measure but no points. This makes perfect sense once you appreciate that having points requires work to produce one, but random points can never be fully produced. This simple presentation gives the appearance, at least to me, that locale theory permits only one definition of randomness, which if true would be a major disadvantage. Algorithmic randomness contains a few moving parts such as whether certain measures can be computably obtained, or whether convergence of a limit is computable or can be computably bounded. Can we gain control over analogous parts of the theory within locale theory? Or are we stuck with Kurtz randomness? There are indications that the Borel hierarchy of sets can be imported into locale theory (See slides by Simpson). from which we could obtain weak n-randomness, so that would be the logical next step to flesh out.\nPerhaps there is another option, which is that locale theory may not by itself offer control over all the extra choices contained in the theory of algorithmic randomness, but that passing from locales to the theory of assemblies in a realizability topos may offer them instead. Topos theory is built on top of locale theory, so this would be like continuing the narrative. In such a case locales would offer the unified big picture of the origins of randomness, which are then exported to different implementations.\nLastly let me speculate on the role of almost-everywhere properties in locale theory. I imagine we could replace statements like\nx∈[0,1] is Schnorr random if and only if every computable function f of bounded variation with effectively integrable derivative f′ is differentiable at x\nwith\nIf f:[0,1]→ℝ is a morphism in 𝖫𝗈𝖼, then f is differentiable on Ran[0,1].\nWe could perhaps drop the explicit requirement of computability because we'd be in a constructive framework already, and instead of stating the result pointwise we'd have a global statement. It remains to properly define smoothness in the locale framework and to work out many details!\nReferences [1] A. Eagle (2019) Chance versus Randomness. In The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, E.

In this series of talks I will tell a story that takes us from the classical definition of a smooth manifold to differential cohesion in a category where we can interpret modal HoTT. I will assume only basic topology and category theory and will provide details that are sometimes waved away. I will also motivate the study of smooth manifolds as a worthy field with surprising results and tough open questions such as the smooth four-dimensional Poincaré conjecture.\nContents 1 Introduction 2 Sheaves on CartSp 3 The algebra of functions 4 The lemmas about smoothness 5 Nilpotents 6 The Kan extention 7 The modality 1 Introduction As someone “classically trained” in differential geometry, my recent adventures in homotopy type theory have made me very excited to explore an entirely new angle on a topic I love. It is the case today that modal HoTT allows us to access smoothness and prove theorems about manifolds, Lie groups and more. In order to participate in this new and exciting field, someone like me needs a bridge. More than one, in fact. The current document is intended as one of those bridges. Starting from the classical definition of a smooth manifold and the category containing these objects and the smooth maps between them, we will define several enlargements of the category until we arrive at something where modal HoTT can be interpreted.\nTo make the most of this process, we will always try to keep track of where smoothness is entering in. It’s not always obvious!\nDefinition 1. A smooth manifold is a Hausdorff topological space M with countable basis, and with a maximal smooth atlas. An atlas is a covering of M by open sets Ui, each of which is the image of a homeomorphism fi:Rn→M (called a chart), such that fj-1∘fi is smooth wherever it is defined. Two atlases are compatible if their union is again an atlas. The maximal atlas is the union of all compatible atlases.\nNote that this definition expresses M as a colimit of a diagram of arrows from ℝn→M, more specifically a pushout. More on this shortly.\nA continuous function f:M→N between two smooth manifolds is defined to be smooth if the appropriate composition with charts is a smooth function between cartesian spaces.\nThe category SmoothMfd has objects the smooth manifolds of any finite dimension, and morphisms the smooth maps.\nThis category, innocuous though it seems, has some strange properties! There are topological manifolds that are missing from it, and some that are way over-represented! You can’t just take a topological manifold and assume you can give it a unique maximal smooth atlas and stick it into SmoothMfd.\nThe table below contains some examples.\nkind of manifold number of inequivalent smooth atlases dim ≤3 1 dim ≥5 ≥0, finite ℝn,n≠4 1 ℝ4 uncountably many S4 unknown, ≥1 dim =4, compact without boundary ≥0, at most countably many dim =4, otherwise ≥1, at most uncountably many The claim that S4 has exactly one smooth structure is known as the four-dimensional smooth Poincaré conjecture. Its status is “extremely unknown”. For more of the beautiful story around four-dimensional topology and smooth structures see the accessible and detailed book by Scorpan [7].\nThe spheres behave surprisingly as well.\nn number of inequivalent smooth atlases on Sn 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 ≥1 5 1 6 1 7 28 8 2 9 8 10 6 11 992 12 1 13 3 14 2 15 16256 16 2 17 16 18 16 19 523264 20 24 (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure)\nIs SmoothMfd a nice category? It does have finite products (cartesian product) and coproducts (disjoint unions). Manifolds are themselves certain colimits. However in this category does not have all limits or colimits, nor is it cartesian closed. For example, consider the equalizer {(x,y)|x⁢y=0}⊂ℝ2. As a set this must be equal to the union of the x-axis and y-axis. But this cannot be given the structure of a topological manifold nor a smooth one, due to the failure to be homeomorphic to any ℝn at the origin. Full argument: the forgetful functor U:𝖲𝗆𝗈𝗈𝗍𝗁𝖬𝖿𝖽→𝖲𝖾𝗍 preserves limits and colimits as it has both left and right adjoints. The equalizer as a set is this union of axes, and so the manifold must have that underlying set. But this set cannot be promoted to a smooth manifold.\nConsider the coequalizer (ℝ2⁢∐ℝ)/(0,0)∼0. Similarly this cannot be given the structure of a topological manifold nor a smooth one, also at the origin.\nIs SmoothMfd cartesian closed, i.e. does it contain function spaces of smooth maps? This has been attempted with some success, but we’ll skip over that story because we’re going to do it with sheaves later. In fact right now.\n2 Sheaves on CartSp My take on presheaves and sheaves is inspired by Daniel Dugger’s informal notes Sheaves and Homotopy Theory[3]. His analogy to generators and relations is the one that clicked for me in this context.\nDefine CartSp to be the full subcategory of SmoothMfd containing just the ℝn for finite n (recall that “full” means include every morphism). In the case of ℝ4 let’s just bring the standard smooth structure. We can try to build the fake ℝ4s later on with surgery and such.\nDue to the existence of real-valued functions such as 11+e-x we can map all of ℝ to the open interval (0,1). So note that this category is not as pitifully empty as I, at least, thought at first. You can cover ℝn with balls each of which is a diffeomorphic image of ℝn. We’ll be doing just that.\nTo generalize SmoothMfd we’ll use CartSp in a new way. In the original atlas-based definition of a smooth manifold we were characterizing manifolds by the slogan “locally isomorphic to ℝn.” This is a way to cash out the more general concept “modeled on ℝn.” But we will now shift to the paradigm “can be probed by ℝn” or equivalently “has specified maps from the test spaces ℝn.” In this framework we will specify probes from all dimensions of cartesian spaces, not just the one that has the same dimension as the manifold (if any such concept as dimension survives our shenanigans).\nA presheaf on CartSp is a functor\n𝖢𝖺𝗋𝗍𝖲𝗉op→Set Think of one presheaf M (suggestive name) as a would-be space together with the specification of what probing functions are smooth. Sometimes these probes are called plots. These are different from charts. Charts are specific homeomorphisms that cover M. Here we must provide the entire set of all possible smooth functions into M from ℝn, for all n.\nThe category Psh(CartSp) consists of all such functors, together with the natural transformations between them. This is an interesting category! If C is any locally small category, there is an embedding (a full and faithful functor that is injective on objects) C→𝖯𝗌𝗁⁢(C) called the Yoneda embedding. In fact Psh(C) is the free cocompletion of C, meaning it freely adds all colimits from C. In fact Psh(C) is a topos which is a checklist of wonderful properties, and we’ll be using them all by the end because HoTT and toposes are closely related. In a nutshell, Psh(C) inherits these nice properties from 𝖲𝖾𝗍.\nBUT.\nIf C already has some colimits, Psh(C) will not respect these. It is too free.\nConsider two subobjects of ℝn in CartSp, say two disjoint open balls U and V.\nFollowing Duggers we think of sheaves as the subcategory of presheaves that preserve the existing colimits that we had. There is an analogy to specifying a group as the quotient of a free group by a subgroup generated by some relations.\nIt’s illustrative to understand the layers of exoticness that are introduced by moving from SmoothMfd to sheaves. Manifolds embed in diffeological spaces which are the concrete sheaves (see Baez and Hoffnung [2]).\n3 The algebra of functions For a smooth manifold M the set of smooth real-valued maps f:M→ℝ has the structure of a vector space, a ring, and in fact a commutative algebra. An algebra is a vector space over a base field (hence it has a commutative addition operation) which also has a multiplication operation that satisfies the distributive law when it interacts with addition. If the multiplication is commutative then we say the algebra is commutative. In this case the operations are all pointwise and so inherited from ℝ. For example f⁢g⁢(x)=f⁢(x)⁢g⁢(x) where the right hand side is multiplication in ℝ.\nProposition 1. Taking the algebra C∞⁢(M) of smooth functions of a smooth manifold M gives a functor 𝖲𝗆𝗈𝗈𝗍𝗁𝖬𝖿𝖽→C∞𝖢𝖠𝗅𝗀Rop.\nThere are important subcategories of 𝖢𝖠𝗅𝗀ℝ that themselves contain the image of this functor, notably the “smooth algebras” but we won’t make use of their special properties, so we might as well use the simpler larger category.\nCrucially this functor is actually faithful, meaning if you fix two manifolds then the functor is injective on the hom set between them. Said another way, any algebra homomorphism C∞⁢(N)→C∞⁢(M) comes from a smooth map M→N. Therefore we can embed SmoothMfd into 𝖢𝖠𝗅𝗀ℝ and treat its image as an equivalent copy of SmoothMfd and find new ways to extend it and build new categories!\nThe proof of faithfulness is interesting and we will explore it fully because it’s challenging to piece it together from the references that exist easily to hand today. Since we have a couple other such “smooth facts” to make use of let’s handle them together.\n4 The lemmas about smoothness Lemma 1. (“Milnor’s Exercise”) The map M→evHom⁢(C∞⁢(M),R)=Hom⁢(C∞⁢(M),C∞⁢(R0)) given by evaluation at a point of M is a bijection.\nProof. See also Kolář, Michor and Slovák [5], especially the preamble before section 35 and Corollary 35.9. Let ϕ∈Hom⁢(C∞⁢(M),ℝ). Then ker⁡(ϕ) is an ideal of codimension 1. (An ideal of an algebra is a vector subspace which is closed under multiplication by an arbitrary element of the algebra.) Consider the collection of zero sets Zf,f∈ker⁡(ϕ). This collection of sets is closed under intersection: given Zf,Zg then Z(f2+g2)=Zf∪Zg and f2+g2∈ker⁡(ϕ). We have satisfied some of the hypotheses of the following topological lemma: Lemma 2. If X is Hausdorff and C⊆X compact, and F={Ci} any collection of closed subsets of C with the property that Ci,Cj∈F⟹Ci∩Cj∈F, then ⋂iCi≠∅.\nWe have a collection of sets closed under intersection, so to satisfy the hypotheses of this new lemma it suffices to show that there is some Zf compact and nonempty, for then we can use this as the set C.\nSuppose for a moment that we had this Zf. Let’s see how we can finish proving Milnor’s exercise. Suppose ⋂f∈ker⁡(ϕ)Zf≠∅, and so it contains some point x. Now consider an arbitrary g∈C∞⁢(M,ℝ). Construct the function g′=g-ϕ⁢(g)⁢1 where the latter term means the constant function with value ϕ⁢(g). Then g′∈ker⁡(ϕ), so g′⁢(x)=0, i.e. g⁢(x)-ϕ⁢(g)⁢1⁢(x)=0 and hence ϕ⁢(g)=g⁢(x), and so ϕ=evx as desired.\nNow to construct the function f whose zero set is compact and nonempty. Back in Definition 1 we assumed all our smooth manifolds are Hausdorff with countable basis. This in turn implies paracompactness, a property that was put on this Earth to supply the existence of a partition of unity, a countable collection of smooth bump functions, each with compact support, and with the collective property that in a neighborhood of any point only finitely many of them are nonzero, and they sum everywhere to the constant function 1. So let’s fix a partition of unity {fi}i∈ℕ. Consider the function\ng=f1+2⁢f2+3⁢f1+⋯. This function is everywhere positive. We claim that for every c\u0026gt;0 that U=g-1⁢([0,c]) is compact. By continuity U is closed. And it must lie in the union of finitely many supports, as the terms n⁢fn grow beyond c eventually. So U is closed and contained in a finite union of compact sets, which is compact, and so U is compact. One more trick: this argument works for g2 as well, possibly with a different value of c. Since the codimention of ker⁡(ϕ) is 1, some linear combination f=a⁢g+b⁢g2=0,a,b∈ℝ. This f carves out a compact nonempty zero set. GCLTODO – what was the gap here at the end? That a, b might be negative? Surely one of them *is* negative? ∎\nIt is perhaps notable that there is a larger class of topological manifolds for which Milnor’s exercise holds, which goes by the name realcompact.\nLemma 3. For two smooth manifolds M1 and M2 the map\nC∞⁢(M1,M2) →Hom⁢(C∞⁢(M2),C∞⁢(M1)) (1) f ↦(g↦g∘f) (2) given by precomposition is a bijection, i.e. 𝖲𝗆𝗈𝗈𝗍𝗁𝖬𝖿𝖽→C∞𝖢𝖠𝗅𝗀Rop is faithful.\nProof. Given ϕ∈Hom⁢(C∞⁢(M2),C∞⁢(M1)) and x1∈M1 we need to produce a point x2∈M2 and to show that this mapping x1↦x2 is smooth. Consider evx1∘ϕ∈Hom⁢(C∞⁢(M2),ℝ):\nC∞⁢(M2)→ϕC∞⁢(M1)→evx1ℝ. By Lemma 1 this is equal to evaluation at some point x2∈M2, so define f:M1→M2 by x1↦x2. We have shown that ϕ⁢(g)=g∘f and so g∘f is smooth for all g, which suffices to prove that f is smooth. ∎\nNote that Lemma 3 is a generalization of Lemma 1 but that we used the latter to prove the former. For our purposes these lemmas serve to allow us to pass to the image of C∞ in the category of algebras and proceed to enlarge it in new ways that ar emade possible by the algebraic setting. We will do that by extending the algebras with nilpotent elements!\n5 Nilpotents An element x∈A of a real algebra is nilpotent if some power of it is zero. For example in the 4-dimensional algebra of 2x2 real matrices the element\nM=(0100) satisfies M2=0. A more important example for us is ℝ⁢[x]/x2, which is the polynomial algebra over ℝ modulo the ideal generated by x2, which is equivalent to adding the relation x2=0. This truncates the polynomials to have degree at most 1, so this is a 2-dimensional real algebra. (Contrast this with ℝ⁢[x]/x2+1 which is also 2-dimensional but does not add any nilpotent elements; it in fact is isomorphic to ℂ.) What if we add nilpotents to the story about algebras of smooth functions?\nNow is a good time to expand our list of facts about smoothness with two more.\nLemma 4. (Hadamard) If f:Rn→R is smooth then in some open neighborhood U⊇(0,…,0)\nf⁢(x1,…,xn)=f⁢(0)+∑i=1nxi⁢gi⁢(x1,…,xn) for smooth functions gi satisfying\ng⁢(0,…,0)=∂⁡f∂⁡xi⁢(x1,…,xn)|(0,…,0) Lemma 5.

I will assume only basic topology and category theory and will provide details that are sometimes waved away.

In addition to fixing a couple of my edits, I have two other problems. First, the file size is too big, and I think I can get decent quality with a lower bit rate and smaller file size. Secondly, there is a white line along the bottom. I believe this is because the software decided to render it at 768x327 instead of 768x328. Many players assume a multiple of four for the resolution, and so put a white line since there\u0026rsquo;s no data on the 328th row.

Maybe I can use a different tool for the transcoding part.\nOh, and by the way, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find any good tools that could work directly from a DVD rip, so I had to encode to H.264 with very high quality and size, edit that, and transcode it. Moreover, I had started off hoping to directly edit the H.264 and just save it out, but the audio kept getting out of sync more and more after each edit. I learned about keyframes, and that\u0026rsquo;s how I found SimpleMovieX, whose primary feature was to let me only visit keyframes while editing, but it helped NOT AT ALL.

Others have voiced enthusiasm, but I think there\u0026rsquo;s another level or two of excitement that folks are missing. So let\u0026rsquo;s hasten the story along because I want to play these games. Let me convince you I\u0026rsquo;m right, and then you can go make some games for me. I\u0026rsquo;ll pay $50 for the games I have in mind. Do you hear me, Matrix, Paradox, Slitherine, Panther, Creative Assembly, SSG, Firaxis, Big Huge Games, TGW, Wizards, and friends?\nThe best examples of strategy games on the iPad right now are Small World and Civilization Revolution. I consider these \u0026ldquo;console-like\u0026rdquo; games, since Civ Rev is in fact a port of a console game, and Small World is in the same vein as the recent spate of board game conversions for XBLA, like Catan, Carcassonne, Lost Cities, and Ticket to Ride. I\u0026rsquo;d like to argue that these titles are not nearly ambitious enough, because I think the iPad can supplant every aspect of PC gaming due to the touch interface. Small World comes closer to what I mean since it uses touch, and it makes excellent use of pretty 2D graphics and sound, but still, it could easily live on XBLA. Conversely, I don\u0026rsquo;t see any reason all of Civ IV couldn\u0026rsquo;t be brought to the iPad.\nThe console comparison, however, is strengthened by the analogy of the App Store to the curated download stores that live in the consoles. John Gruber of daringfireball.net makes the case that the iPad and iPhone are best thought of as \u0026ldquo;app consoles\u0026rdquo; (see here). So I expect to see games that are only as ambitious as XBLA titles for a while, but I am sure much more is possible.\nHolding the iPad in your hands and using your fingers is a whole different level of control than that offered by the game consoles. An iPad is great for reading, and for touching. It offers terrific precision, and greater immersion than a PC. It has a gaggle of new UI paradigms that are best observed in the non-game apps that exist now, like Mail, Pages and Keynote. The popover menu is one example (see here). All of this can bring nice, neat order to complex interfaces. This, in fact, is one of Apple\u0026rsquo;s strengths.\nI also feel strongly that reading on the iPad is an entirely different experience than reading on a laptop screen or monitor. There is empirical evidence to back this up here (punchline: reading on an iPad, Kindle, or from a real book scores about 5.7/7 whereas reading on the PC scores 3.6/7). But you don\u0026rsquo;t need the studies really, because if you try one you will see. Reading web pages on the iPad is actually a joyful experience. My theory is that the brain processes visual input differently when it\u0026rsquo;s being held in your hands. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the reinforcement coming from using two of your senses, even if all there is to touch is smooth glass. Whatever the reason, and however surprising it seems to you, it\u0026rsquo;s just not the same medium as the PC screen.\nSo the iPad offers a device where reading is superior to a PC, interactivity is superior in many ways (every device has an accelerometer, compass, and a mic and speakers, which developers can count on), and the UI is different, and arguably superior, but certainly not inferior (touch versus mouse). Plus new UI paradigms exist that smart designers can take advantage of to bridge the remaining gap in screen real estate. So why limit ourselves to ports of simple boardgames? I want to see Advanced Squad Leader and other wargames brought to the iPad as ports from the physical games. I want to see all the Paradox titles and SSG and Panther wargames brought over, as ports from the PC games. (Strangely enough, Paradox announced an iPhone port of Hearts of Iron and Majesty in 2008, but then never followed up in words or deeds. The press release has been removed from their archive, but some game sites are still tracking the HOI port, like IGN.) I want to see the back catalog brought over as well: X-Com, Heroes of Might and Magic, you name it! (Someone is working on DOSBox for iOS, called DOSPad, but it will probably not be approved given current App Store policies.) I\u0026rsquo;m just naming the games of most interest to me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really see any limitation.\nAfter all those games are brought over, there\u0026rsquo;s even another level we can go, because none of these ports will make full use of the accelerometer and multitouch capabilities, and the greater immersion possible on the iPad. I can\u0026rsquo;t foresee those games, though, because I\u0026rsquo;m not a designer. One category of example for the hardcore strategy gamer might be a hybrid approach where a board game or wargame with lots of rules and calculations could have a tabletop component and an iPad component that makes playing more fun. You could even take that idea to the next level by making the game even more complex without adding strain to the players. It would be some sort of interactive engine that contains all the rules. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite. Maybe what we want are sandboxes with lots of pieces and board configurations, and we can play whatever game we want and enforce the rules ourselves like with boardgames. I\u0026rsquo;d especially love a sandbox that came with MTG cards but didn\u0026rsquo;t force the linear application of rules into the UI the way Duels of the Planeswalkers does, but rather leaves it up to me like OCTGN2 or Magic Workstation.\nOK, having said ALL of that, I actually do like the way things are going. There\u0026rsquo;s an X-COM clone in the works for iPad (Isochron), and plenty of SRPG originals and ports coming (e.g., Final Fantasy Tactics in September). As I learned on Three Moves Ahead, Small World was profitable for Days of Wonder on its first day of release, so that will surely be noticed, and hopefully at least all the XBLA board games will be brought over. But what I really want is EU3!\n","date":1278789583,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1278789583,"objectID":"c6893199dbc403ec425156a7141ef0df","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2010-07-10-lets-hurry-along-the-ipad-gaming-revolution/","publishdate":"2010-07-10T19:19:43Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2010-07-10-lets-hurry-along-the-ipad-gaming-revolution/","section":"posts","summary":"I am so excited at the possibilities the iPad holds for gaming, especially strategy gaming.

I even love reading long computer game manuals for complicated games like Europa Universalis 3. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to learn the beginning of a new field, because there are usually some audiobooks, Teaching Company courses, or online materials to introduce you to the main concepts. But what if you already know a lot about something, and you want to learn even more?\nWhat if you are already educated in a field, and you want to learn about a sub-field, or a more advanced version of what you already know? Here, your options are more limited. If you are lucky enough to live near a college or university, and that university teaches in your field, and offers a course in the sub-field you want to explore, and you have time to audit a course, and the professor permits you to audit, and you manage to attend twice a week while holding down a job, then goody for you! I am almost in that boat, since I live in Pittsburgh, which has several colleges and universities, including two major universities that have several departments covering the areas I love. In browsing the Fall 2010 class schedules, I see a few courses I\u0026rsquo;d like to take. Some are more related to work, some are more related to my past life as a mathematician. If I convince myself I should take time during the work day to take a class, then I might be in luck. But what if I specifically wanted to take a graduate-level class in, say, algebraic geometry, and none was on offer in the Fall? Are there online algebraic geometry courses?\nNo. Believe me, I looked everywhere. MSRI has lots of lectures posted online, and they are usually long workshops that might constitute a good introduction to a subject, but their videos are all broken and have been since I first went to the site, and are still broken three weeks after I wrote to inform them they were broken. I looked at everything in iTunes U, and those cover mainly undergraduate topics, and the few exceptions were not interesting to me. I looked at MIT OpenCourseware, but everything with video lectures is on iTunes U, which I already know doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover what I want. Lecture notes don\u0026rsquo;t help any more than books.\nSo what about books? I have lots of books. I have one next to me called \u0026ldquo;Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators\u0026rdquo; which is beautiful and fun to read. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have the discipline to work through it all alone. I need the structure of a class, or a seminar.\nAn informal seminar would be fantastic. If I knew someone in Pittsburgh who wanted to work through \u0026ldquo;Heat Kernels\u0026rdquo; with me, that would probably be the best possible outcome. But the odds that there is such a person and that I will meet them during my limited time outside of work is zilch.\nWhich brings me to my dual proposal for the world. First, please record video of all your graduate courses and sell them on iTunes, or offer them free through iTunes U, or offer them to distance learning students at a reasonable rate, and make the course easy to find. I mean, my own alma mater, Columbia University, should offer me, an alumnus, video of all the math department courses. I\u0026rsquo;d love them for it. Yes I took some of those courses, but now, years later, I\u0026rsquo;d take different ones, and different ones would be offered than were offered during my years there anyway, and it would be great.\nPart two of my proposal is for the Web 2.0 entrepreneurs. Let me meet, non-awkwardly, on a web site, people like myself, and form an ad-hoc videoconferencing seminar. We would agree on the reading material, and take turns presenting chapters or sections of the material, like in a regular seminar. Video skype, plus screen sharing or web conferencing, plus whiteboards, it could totally work! The technology all exists, we just need a way to find each other, and to have a web site with enough features to support it. Should I create it? Would anybody show up? Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll post to mathoverflow.com and see if anyone agrees.\n","date":1269399083,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1269399083,"objectID":"44c2360ccd7904a4330920722bbb2359","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2010-03-24-distance-learning-for-the-over-educated/","publishdate":"2010-03-24T02:51:23Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2010-03-24-distance-learning-for-the-over-educated/","section":"posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m definitely a \u0026ldquo;lifelong learner\u0026rdquo; type, always craving new courses, books, or ideas.

What do you think ought to happen? What do you wish would happen? What do you think computers are capable of enabling to happen?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what happens on a Mac: it plays the movie, and on Windows and all other operating systems, it does not. This is not about iTunes. The distinction holds for any piece of software at all that maintains pointers to files, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a media organizer, or a Recent Documents feature in a word processor. This is because on Windows, there is no other system-provided mechanism for storing file locations besides paths. Paths include the name of all enclosing folders, plus the filename, plus of course the drive letter on Windows, e.g. \u0026ldquo;C:\\Documents and Settings\\Greg\\My Movies\\Sesame Street Season 1 part 1.m4v\u0026rdquo;. If I change the path to include \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; partway along the chain, which is what moving the file into \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; amounts to, then the path has changed and the original path is invalid, it points to nothing.\nI will not describe the technical details of the mechanism the Mac uses instead, because frankly it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, that\u0026rsquo;s the whole point. It\u0026rsquo;s a smart piece of technology that hides from the user, but enables the user to work in a more intuitive way. It permits all software not to be sensitive to changes the user makes to the locations of files or folders.\nThis mechanism has existed since the early days of the Mac. It\u0026rsquo;s not some fancy modern cpu-intensive disk-intensive feature that indexes your hard drive or anything. It\u0026rsquo;s just a better way of storing file locations in software, since users like to move stuff around.\nThis is one of those differences that I usually have trouble articulating, but subconsciously affects all my decisions, just like the fragility of paths affects many of my decisions when I\u0026rsquo;m using Windows.\n","date":1248664485,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1248664485,"objectID":"79ab83618a933db94f45d3a580a7e680","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2009-07-27-mac-moments-not-using-paths/","publishdate":"2009-07-27T03:14:45Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2009-07-27-mac-moments-not-using-paths/","section":"posts","summary":"On my Mac, I had a movie in my Movies folder called \u0026ldquo;Sesame Street Season 1 part 1.m4v\u0026rdquo;.

People still write these games, did you know that? There\u0026rsquo;s a big archive and an annual competition. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played any of the non-Infocom variety, though I think I ought to try one. I have copies of all the data files for all the original Infocom games from the 80s, and for years there has been an open-source program to load these files and let you play the games. It\u0026rsquo;s called Frotz. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a version of Frotz on all my computers for the last 12 years, including my various Palm PDAs. The only Infocom game I\u0026rsquo;ve ever finished in my life (making it one of like 5 games of any variety that I have ever finished) was \u0026ldquo;Enchanter\u0026rdquo;, which I played on the Palm. The latest incarnation of Frotz is for the iPhone, and so of course I downloaded it right away.\nPDAs in general are not the easiest devices to type on, though, and there\u0026rsquo;s lots of typing in Infocom games. So it occurred to me that it would be really cool to speak the commands. After all, there is a limited vocabulary, which should be ideal for getting good accuracy from automatic speech recognition, and furthermore the engine should require a pretty small amount of data. On top of that, what if Frotz synthesized a (pleasant, configurable) computer voice to read you all the text in the game? Then you could set the iPhone down in front of you, close your eyes, and enjoy a nice bit of interactive fiction by having a dialog with thin air. All of a sudden the very stodgiest and oldest of technology leapfrogs three decades of competition and actually sounds futuristic! I patted myself on the back for thinking of such a great idea, and told myself I\u0026rsquo;d take a stab at it myself \u0026ldquo;one day,\u0026rdquo; since speech recognition is just a hop, skip and a jump away from machine translation.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not all, there\u0026rsquo;s a punchline to this story. It further occurred to me that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been the first to think of this idea, so I did a Google search. The link I found is inside a code repository for Frotz itself, namely the iPhone version. Actually, this is just a branch of Frotz, so I checked the general Frotz SourceForge repository as well and the same file is there too. It\u0026rsquo;s a placeholder for future work on just this idea, but it\u0026rsquo;s super-vague and kind of creepy, what with the whole \u0026ldquo;commissioned by a presently undisclosed party\u0026rdquo; thing. The technology looks good, it\u0026rsquo;s all open-source stuff released by academics, which was where I figured I would start looking as well.\nSo who wrote this document, and when, and when do they intend to come out of the shadows with the result of their work?

Then in my junior year the first consequence of my nihilistic lifestyle happened, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t even really notice it for what it was until years later. I switched my major from Astronomy to Astrophysics, then I added a concentration (minor) in Math, and then I made Math a second major. This all happened within a couple of months. Even these bureaucratic thrashings didn\u0026rsquo;t raise any red flags in any administrators or professors. No one cared. So, I shifted my focus to math, threw away the pile of physics grad school applications I had, and requested a bunch of math ones. I went to graduate school for a year at Stony Brook, then transferred back to Columbia for the rest of my Ph.D., because my then-girlfriend, now-wife, was continuing on from Columbia undergrad to grad school.\nOK, here\u0026rsquo;s the denoument to the story. In my second year or so, the reference librarian of the math library was leaving Columbia, and she was well-liked by the department. I had worked for her as an undergraduate, so I was invited to her going away party. At that party, there was a professor who was a fixture in the math department. He was the kind of professor who was very focused on undergraduates and mentoring. I had never had a class with him, and had never met him personally until I was a graduate student. We got to chatting, and it came out that I had attended Columbia as an undergrad as well as a grad student. He was shocked. \u0026ldquo;How is it that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember you?\u0026rdquo; he asked. My answer was \u0026ldquo;I do a good job of going under the radar.\u0026rdquo;\nThis story brings me a whole lot of pain. I know that I somehow failed to do \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; right as an undergrad. All those times I walked straight back to my room to lie on my back, have a cigarette, and listen to music, I suspected that I was doing the wrong thing. I knew I should be doing \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; or seeking more opportunities. But how do you do that? I have never been good at taking that feeling and turning it into non-ridiculous-looking actions. But I also suspect that others also failed me. The professors who taught me recognized my talent, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. A few years later I heard from a third party that one of them had called me \u0026ldquo;the best mathematician he has ever met.\u0026rdquo; WTF? Why weren\u0026rsquo;t these people looking out for me, then? Couldn\u0026rsquo;t they see that I had lots of talent but no direction? Professors like the one I was talking to at the going-away party do in fact devote lots of energy to nurturing undergrads. Just not me. So I waver between self-loathing and bitterness.\nI am determined to make at least one good thing out of this part of my life story. I will be an excellent mentor, and I will always act when I spot talent. It\u0026rsquo;s happened plenty at my job, and I have been very vocal about singing the praise of new young employees who are talented. I have been instrumental in having them promoted and being assigned interesting work. I will do what was not done for me. The best would be if I ran across someone like myself, who was incapable of grabbing this kind of attention for him or herself. I will see their talent, and their reticence, and I will help them.\n","date":1215663041,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1215663041,"objectID":"c4017d11e5425ad4c93c080bd6d1b8ad","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2008-07-10-on-the-importance-of-mentors/","publishdate":"2008-07-10T04:10:41Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2008-07-10-on-the-importance-of-mentors/","section":"posts","summary":"I grew up assuming that people make their own way in the world.

It\u0026rsquo;s a lot like Windows Media Player, which I despise, but actually if you own an Xbox 360 there are two reasons to install the Zune software even if you don\u0026rsquo;t own a Zune:\nIt can serve MPEG4 and H.264 movies to the Xbox. It can synchronize its music library and playlists with iTunes automatically, and serve those to the Xbox as well. H.264 is a popular media format supported by many devices: iPod, Zune, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Tivo. Files in this format are sold by the Xbox movie store and the iTunes store. It is also one of the underlying formats supported on both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD formats. So it\u0026rsquo;s important to be able to get all your videos in that format, and when you do, you want to play them on your Xbox 360 in HD, right? Right! Well, the Zune software is the easiest way to do that. It has the same media sharing features (and dialog boxes) as Windows Media Player, it just supports more formats.\nAs for syncing with iTunes, I just discovered this over the weekend. It does not support playing DRM music purchased at the iTunes store, but as DRM starts to disappear, this will matter less over time. I activated the feature (here are the instructions I used), and after a long time all my iTunes regular playlists did in fact appear in Zune and on my Xbox 360 as well (under the Music item of course). But none of my iTunes smart playlists made it over, which is a shame because I use them rather heavily. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll have to make static playlist copies of the ones I care about.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t yet discovered how often it syncs up with iTunes, but I\u0026rsquo;ll find out once I make those static playlists.\nYou can download the Zune software from Microsoft.\n","date":1191866734,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1191866734,"objectID":"0a285b589c1c57252c722257f9c1cbbd","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2007-10-08-two-reasons-to-download-microsofts-zune-software/","publishdate":"2007-10-08T18:05:34Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2007-10-08-two-reasons-to-download-microsofts-zune-software/","section":"posts","summary":"Microsoft includes a Windows-based desktop media player with their Zune portable media players, to manage your music and sync it with the Zune.

Rebooting my computer is a big deal, and takes a long time, on both platforms. At work, I usually have quite a bit of my own personal state of mind reflected in what\u0026rsquo;s running. I have many command-line sessions, documents, notes, and web browser windows open. These can only be reinstated by re-opening each item one at a time, which takes effort, and constitutes a major interruption, probably 20 minutes before my mind and machine are back where they were. I think interruption is a major drag on productivity in todays multitasking environments, and being able to concentrate for long times is precious. Certainly it adds to my stress to have to bring all this stuff back up when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting it.\nHere is how the two platforms deal with this issue. On the Mac, every so often, a program called Software Update runs by itself. It looks like this:\nThe Mac\u0026rsquo;s Software Update interface\nThe main thing I want you to notice is the very leftmost column, where the Java update has a blank and the other two have a little power icon. The legend at the bottom says \u0026ldquo;Restart will be required.\u0026rdquo; Each update has its own checkbox controlling whether to install it right now or not, and some text below explains more about the update. The main point I\u0026rsquo;d like to make is that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to install any updates that require a restart right now, if I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. If I don\u0026rsquo;t want to reboot, then I can install the Java update, or not, then I can quit Software Update and keep working. When the internal schedule again causes Software Update to run, or if I go myself to run it to catch up on updates, the updates I skipped will still be there.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it works on Windows. I think I have my machine set up in the most agreeable way as far as this process goes, but if you know of better settings, let me know. Every so often a balloon appears in the tray, asking me to click to check out some updates that are ready to be installed. I set things up so that they\u0026rsquo;re already downloaded. When you click the balloon, you are asked to Express Install, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you anything about what the updates are. If you choose to Manually Install, you see the following:\nWindows XP\u0026rsquo;s software update interface\nThis is similar to the Mac in many ways, but note that in the text description, it says \u0026ldquo;After you install this item, you may have to restart your computer.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that same text there so many times, it became the motivation for this post. I want to install updates that don\u0026rsquo;t require restarts right now, and I\u0026rsquo;ll install the ones that require a restart later, at the end of the week, before I go home for the weekend, which is when I don\u0026rsquo;t mind rebooting my machine. Microsoft neglects to indicate what will happen with this update! Why? Don\u0026rsquo;t they know? If not, why have they made that impossible for themselves? If they do know, why don\u0026rsquo;t they tell me? I think this entire question would be completely lost on them. I say that because anyone who grasps this issue would just tell me! Even if they merely had done a better job copying the Mac they\u0026rsquo;d have gotten it right. As it is, I end up not installing updates like this because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to take the gamble of spending the next 20 minutes finding my place in my work again. Basically, I treat it as if it requires a restart.\nOne day, with the update pictured above in fact, I took the plunge, and decided to run the update. What happens next compounds the stupidity of the problem. First there\u0026rsquo;s this:\nYou lose\nSo, I lost the gamble. \u0026ldquo;May have to restart\u0026rdquo; became \u0026ldquo;must restart.\u0026rdquo; I was busy, so I clicked \u0026ldquo;Close.\u0026rdquo; Now this is the best part. Every 30 minutes for the next three work days, the following dialog came up and I had to dismiss it:\nThe dialog I saw dozens of times\nEach time this dialog came up, I grimaced and made a decision whether it was worth it to reboot and get rid of this assinine annoyance, or simply click the \u0026ldquo;Restart Later\u0026rdquo; button and keep doing my job. Finally after a couple days of clicking \u0026ldquo;Restart Later\u0026rdquo;, I gave up and clicked \u0026ldquo;Restart Now\u0026rdquo; and lost the 20 minutes it takes to get back up and running.\nThe conclusion can only be that Microsoft doesn\u0026rsquo;t care. And I don\u0026rsquo;t mean that in a small way, I mean it in a big way. This is the kind of nuisance that Windows presents every single day, to tens of millions of computer users. They are grinding us all down with their deprioritization of us, their human users. So I don\u0026rsquo;t even need to argue in this case that Apple is more user-friendly. This case clearly shows that Microsoft has a deep lack of understanding not only of what computers are for, but also what people are for.\n","date":1177472652,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177472652,"objectID":"277b1734b4f4dc065deadb24b49d2caa","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2007-04-25-mac-moments-software-update/","publishdate":"2007-04-25T03:44:12Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2007-04-25-mac-moments-software-update/","section":"posts","summary":"Makers of software demonstrate their values in their products.

This post presents a great example of this, namely OS updates.\n","tags":null,"title":"Mac Moments: Software update","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Tech"],"content":"Within the last year, I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased both an Xbox 360 and an HDTV (a 37\u0026quot; Sharp Aquos LCD). I have a TiVo, a home network, a Powerbook, and a fast PC with lots of storage. Surely somewhere in all of that is a viable, clean, easy to use method of expanding what I can enjoy on my home entertainment center to include my iTunes music, any downloaded video files, saved TiVo videos, and personal photos.\nThe executive summary is that I\u0026rsquo;m going to be purchasing a Mac Mini when they are next updated by Apple (should be soon), because that is going to be the most flexible entertainment hub. I also learned that our household is more of an Apple shop than I had guessed, mainly due to iTunes.\nI have tried several scenarios, mostly focused on viewing downloaded TV shows on my TV:\nStreaming videos from Windows XP to the Xbox with on-the-fly re-encoding (explained below) Streaming videos from Windows XP to the Xbox with manually re-encoded files Streaming videos from Windows Vista Media Center to the Xbox Playing videos on TiVo Using my PowerBook plugged directly into the TV to play movies using Front Row The Xbox 360 is designed to talk to any Windows XP machine using Media Player 11, or to Windows Media Center. You use different areas of the Xbox menus to access either of these two, and they have some differences and similarities. If you are connecting to plain Media Player, say for Videos, then you access a \u0026ldquo;Videos\u0026rdquo; item on the Xbox and it connects to the PC and shows a flat list of videos. Here are a few reasons that this seemingly futuristic capability completely sucks:\nThe Xbox can only play movies in WMV format, which is very rarely used anywhere. This means that almost any video you already have, and any TV show you download from the internet, is in the wrong format to play on the Xbox. But let\u0026rsquo;s pretend for a minute that you\u0026rsquo;ve converted everything to this format, as there are other things that suck. The video listing you get is a flat list with no playlists or other organizing schemes, and only the filename is shown, with no way to give it a piece of metadata like a title. This just does not scale to even 3 seasons of TV shows. When you play a video, you cannot resume playback to a previously-viewed point. You have to fastforward to where you were. This is a typical Microsoft UI oversight, and we ran into this issue approximately EVERY DAY. To populate this list in the first place, you must share your Windows Media Player 11 library using \u0026ldquo;media sharing\u0026rdquo;. This seemed cool at first, since I thought that like iTunes, your library would be shared, since that\u0026rsquo;s what the name says. Nope. None of your playlists are shared for videos, only your audio playlists. Instead, only the videos that live inside so-called \u0026ldquo;Watched Folders\u0026rdquo; are shared. This means you have to get Media Player to monitor a folder and have it always add any new files to your library. To me, the purpose of a media library is so that I can carefully catalog my personal media files, not use it as a dumping-ground of all files. On top of this, of course it does not work properly, so that when I had a new folder with 10 video files in a monitored location, only 8 of them would appear automatically, and I had to add the last two manually. Wow. Let\u0026rsquo;s go back and discuss WMV. When you convert one type of media encoding to another, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;re-encoding.\u0026rdquo; So one must re-encode any movie in Xvid of Divx format (e.g. all downloaded TV shows) into WMV. There is a program called TVersity that comes really close to making this problem disappear. What it does is let you add any movie files to its list, and this list appears on the Xbox under the Videos area. So one cool thing is that it\u0026rsquo;s simulating the media sharing feature of Media Player. But what\u0026rsquo;s even cooler is that it will serve the Xbox an on-the-fly re-encoded WMV stream instead of the original file. This lets you have lots of Xvid files around, but the Xbox can still play them. Here are the disappointments of this setup:\nYou cannot fastforward or rewind in a stream. So basically you can pause your videos, or stop them and restart from the beginning. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Not too flexible. My PC (an Athlon XP 2500+) is evidently too slow to do all this in real time, despite playing with the setttings. So there were always 5-10 pauses per half-hour show, of 30 seconds each, each of which ended up skipping over a few seconds of video. At this stage (I\u0026rsquo;m progressing chronologically through my experiments in this narrative), I decided I\u0026rsquo;d try to just re-encode a given season of a TV show we were watching all at once into WMV using some tool, and then stream these using media sharing. So I found a tool called Encode360 that has the Xbox in mind, and I started to re-encode. Here were the disappointments of this approach:\nThere are three flavors of WMV. The best quality is offered by so-called WVC1, but to encode a 30 minute show in this format took about 90 minutes. Moreover, after doing two or three shows, Encode360 would crash, and so what should have finished in a day or so took me a week of restarting jobs before work and before going to bed. If you use the lower levels of WMV quality, you have to up the bitrate to get watchable video. But bitrate is directly proportional to file size, and so a 300MB Xvid file would become a 1GB WMV file. And since I want to keep the Xvid original, that\u0026rsquo;s 1.3G per half-hour show! Now let\u0026rsquo;s talk about Media Center. You can think of it as a special version of Media Player that looks great on a TV and is easy to navigate with a remote control. It connects to a Media Center PC which itself runs a very similar-looking full-screen interface. Basically the Media Center PC streams all its data to the Xbox, so it becomes another way to view videos, music and photos. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really solve any of the above problems with encoding, since the Xbox still needs WMV format movies even inside Media Center. But if I were to re-encode all the movies myself (maybe by finding a better tool than Encode360) then maybe I could at least have a better organized interface for browsing playlists and having real Title metadata. Also, there\u0026rsquo;s a plugin for Media Center that does what TVersity does (re-encode to WMV on the fly), but it crashed Media Center the first time I tried it. I like the Media Center interface, and if it let me organize movies I guess that would make me happy. But I still need to do all that re-encoding work, which I\u0026rsquo;m not willing to do.\nOne more item on Media Center. It also shares photos and music to the Xbox, but its whole metaphor for photos is just stupid old hard drive folders and filenames. We have tools like iPhoto on the Mac and Picasa on Windows now, that have transcended this old model by light-years. What about storing photos in albums? Or giving them Titles instead of filenames? Or giving them other metadata like tags and comments? None of this is in Media Center from what I could see. We have to keep everything organized by folder and filename, which is not where metadata should live. Lastly, if you use an iPod and buy music from iTunes, then the music sharing is not useful to you, since it can\u0026rsquo;t play protected iTunes music, nor can it see your iTunes playlists.\nTransitioning now, I have two friends at work who swear by Media Center. When I complained about my woes with the Xbox, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t relate 100% because their setups are different in one key way: They have their PCs in their living rooms, directly connected to the home theater. They have so-called HTPCs (Home Theater PCs), and so they can play whatever video formats they want, since the Xbox is not involved. If you want one of these, then you need a new computer. But if you\u0026rsquo;re going to go to that trouble, why not get a Mac Mini, which has Front Row, a similar piece of software to Media Center. I decided to try this by installing Front Row on my Powerbook, hooking it up to the TV, and seeing what was possible. Here are the wins.\nI can play any video file (MPEG, Xvid, Divx), since now you\u0026rsquo;re using a Real Computer I can play iTunes music, including using actual, real library sharing from the iTunes library on my PC (the main repository of music in our house) I can see my iPhoto library, which I don\u0026rsquo;t use since the photos are on our PC, so it\u0026rsquo;s not so useful to me, but iPhoto is better than flat folders and files, so it wins in principle I can add videos to iTunes and give them Title metadata rather than use filenames. I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to find out if I can make playlists of videos. To do any of this, you need to use QuickTime to make a so-called \u0026ldquo;reference movie\u0026rdquo;, which is a small file that a) can be added to iTunes, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t accept .avi files directly and b) refers to the original and plays it, saving the space of a full re-encoding. The interface is nice of course, but comparably nice versus Media Center You can view video podcasts, something Media Player cannot do without third-party add-ins. This was a breakthrough when I tried it using my PowerBook. I still kept all the movie files on my PC, and used file sharing to play them over the network. If I buy an inexpensive Mac Mini, I can make it its own component in my home theater and use Front Row all the time. If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering where Apple TV fits into this, it would provide a similar setup to a Mac Mini for less money, but it can only play MPEG4 and QuickTIme movies, which puts you in a re-encoding situation similar to the Xbox. But at least MPEG4 is a real open format with lots of tools available, unlike WMV.\nTiVo was a nonstarter by the way, since although it can connect to a PC to play files, it can only play TiVo MPEG2 files.\nLastly, when it comes to recording TV shows over cable TV or satellite, you have another set of choices. Media Center and TiVo both do this, but not Front Row or Apple TV. If you want to record HD, you need to either buy a $2,000 HTPC or an $800 TiVo Series 3. When the Series 3 drops in price, I\u0026rsquo;ll consider getting one.\n","date":1170612847,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1170612847,"objectID":"b6a4dc5ca9b9fcb04c6eff8c7cba8a9d","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2007-02-04-one-view-on-the-state-of-media-in-the-home/","publishdate":"2007-02-04T18:14:07Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2007-02-04-one-view-on-the-state-of-media-in-the-home/","section":"posts","summary":"Within the last year, I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased both an Xbox 360 and an HDTV (a 37\u0026quot; Sharp Aquos LCD).

I wanted to share a short section from the manual, because it gets me pretty excited to play and so I thought it would be a good illustration to share:\nThe Eastern Front - January 1944.\nAnother severe Russian winter and months of devastating retreats have forced Manstein\u0026rsquo;s once mighty Army Group South to its knees. Weakened by innumerable losses and defeats, the 8th Army and 1st Panzer Army desperately defend a tenuous portion of the Dnieper River in a salient 50 kilometres west of the city of Cherkassy. OKH demands this portion of river be held as the bridgehead for a renewed summer offensive - an offensive that would never - could never - materialize.\nThe salient invites encirclement and on January 24th and 25th the Soviets happily oblige. Fuelled by their enormous victories the previous summer, five full armies of mechanised and Armored troops of the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts burst through the tired German defence creating the first major encirclement since Stalingrad the previous winter. Their objective? To surround and crush the German forces against the River Dnieper.\nIn a flawed strategy only too familiar to his weary generals, Hitler refuses a withdrawal and by doing so, seems to seal the fate of yet another army. Within 4 days the Russians link up near the town of Lysyanko, trapping the German XLII and XI Army Korps, a pocket of 60,000 troops, behind enemy lines.\nCentred on the city of Korsun, the forlorn Germans are forced to fight for their lives with only a minor airfield to sustain them. They are trapped without hope of surviving, destined for the POW cages east of the Urals. Or are they? Amongst the trapped units is the mighty 5th SS Wiking Division and they are not going to go down without a fight\u0026hellip;\nKorsun Pocket recreates the formation of that pocket, and the desperate German attempts to relieve it in the days that followed. Players control brigade, regimental and battalion sized units on a map spanning more than 28,500 km2, manoeuvring and fighting with the historical units present in the campaign. Off-board support, air interdiction and replacements are all faithfully recreated to assist the player in his quest.\nThe game\u0026rsquo;s five scenarios cover the most exciting aspects of the battle and include a full campaign game which allows you to re-fight the entire battle. A series of fictional tutorial scenarios take you through the game mechanics and are highly recommended.\nCan you as the Soviet Commander create and defeat the German pocket before strong panzer reinforcements intervene?\nAs German Commander, can you obey your Fuhrer\u0026rsquo;s orders and hang on to the Dnieper against all odds?\nThe reason this gets me excited is because I stand to learn a great deal about military strategy and tactics, as well as gaining a more detailed context for my understanding of the 20th century\u0026rsquo;s wars.\nThere is a new World War I game coming soon, also from Matrix (they\u0026rsquo;re the publisher, not the developer), called The Guns of August, which I will definitely also get, since currently I\u0026rsquo;ve read more about that war.\n","date":1165261243,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1165261243,"objectID":"201a5a0f890a5bf88d26e6b3b4c08260","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2006-12-04-korsun-pocket/","publishdate":"2006-12-04T19:40:43Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2006-12-04-korsun-pocket/","section":"posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve bought my first computer wargame, called Korsun Pocket, from Matrix Games.

(See part 1 and part 2.)\nBy definition, a scientific theory is a model of a part of the world that makes verifiable and falsifiable predictions about specific observations. To answer this question, I will reformulate the statement of ID. Behe\u0026rsquo;s formulation looks like this (this is not a quote, I\u0026rsquo;m summing up his argument):\nMy summary of Behe\u0026rsquo;s argument:\nI want to say up front that I am not going to attack the probability part of this argument in order to argue whether it is scientific. It is perfectly reasonable to say that something we observe has a very low probability of arising from some process, and to remove evidence from the applicability of that process in so doing. If you can demonstrate what that probability is. In a further essay I will look at this issue more closely, but only when I want to discuss the correctness of ID, not whether it is a scientific theory in the first place, which is our current aim.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to reformulate the statement above summarizing Behe a couple times to draw out out what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. I expect that an ID enthusiast will object to my reformulations at some point because the conclusion will follow immediately from the final reformulation, but I wonder where the objections will arise exactly.\nReformulation 1:\nI will now add to the discussion that I fully grant that all of Behe\u0026rsquo;s examples are in fact irreducibly complex, which simply means that the systems involve several interacting parts without any one of which the system fails to function. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple to define concept, and surely his examples are all in fact irreducibly complex. Granted. Now, also losing the bit about probability, we can reformulate:\nReformulation 2:\nThis is entirely equivalent to Behe\u0026rsquo;s statement of ID, once you remove the question about whether the systems are irreducibly complex, and replacing the caveat about probability with the blank statement \u0026ldquo;cannot explain.\u0026rdquo; If you agree with the complexity part, then all ID says is that evolution cannot explain this complexity.\nThe problem with ID is that this not the statement of a scientific theory. It is the contradiction of one, namely of evolution. It only makes one prediction, that evolution will not be able to explain irreducible complexity. The only way to study this idea is to study the evolution of molecular systems and try to explain how the irreducible complexity of some particular system came to be. See, ID doesn\u0026rsquo;t substitute anything for evolution, it merely fills the gap it creates with the Designer. It cannot make any new predictions, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t try.\nHere is an analogous scenario. The 6 o\u0026rsquo;clock news reports that there are crop circles on a farm outside town. A scientist on TV expresses his theory that it is the work of teenagers playing a prank. Another scientist puts forward the theory that the crop circles cannot be explained as the work of humans, they must be the work of extraterrestrials. Furthermore, the second scientist argues that his theory is just as scientific as the first theory, because they both purport to explain a particular phenomenon. The problem with the second theory is that its central claim is that the first claim is wrong, and in so doing it creates a gap, which it then fills with extraterrestrials. But the gap is not a theory, just the contradiction of one. The way to proceed to investigate crop circles, then, is to pursue the first theory and try to find a natural explanation. That\u0026rsquo;s the same course of action we\u0026rsquo;d take if there was no second theory. And of course crop circles were eventually found to be easily made by teenagers using planks of wood with rope handles to press down the crops in just a few hours overnight.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the same with ID. The way to pursue this issue is to investigate natural ways that these irreducibly complex systems may have come about. That\u0026rsquo;s the same approach we\u0026rsquo;d take if there was no ID theory. ID theory adds nothing and makes no claims other than to contradict an existing line of inquiry.\nThe funny thing is that ID is falsifiable. Finding a viable evolutionary path for the cilium or any of the systems Behe is interested in will falsify ID, and Behe himself points this out. That\u0026rsquo;s an important point, because when I started this line of thinking I assumed I\u0026rsquo;d be determining that ID isn\u0026rsquo;t falsifiable. What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned instead is that ID isn\u0026rsquo;t predictive. No theory whose statement can be summarized as \u0026ldquo;that other theory over there won\u0026rsquo;t work in this case\u0026rdquo; is predictive. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any claims of its own that can be tested, and so the only way to investigate it is to investigate the original theory, making the contradictory theory actually meaningless.\nWhat does this tell us about teaching ID in science classes? My short answer is that since it is not a scientific theory, it should not be taught. It certainly should not be required, and probably its absence should be required. But why? Because science is about skepticism, model-building and model-testing. It\u0026rsquo;s never about authority, never about personal preferences. It makes no contact with our political or spiritual structures. It is completely confined, completely focused on material predictions that can be tested and falsified. Theories that limit the domain of science, the way ID claims science will never apply to certain biological systems, may or may not be correct. But science does not place such limitiations on itself, for to do so is impossible within the framework of science. Scientists will be the first to admit that they have a poor understanding of how evolution applies to sub-cellular systems. Science demands such concessions \u0026ndash; science is the requirement to make such concessions. And that state of affairs may continue to hold for a million years for all I know. It does not change the central point, that science is a process for adding to the accuracy of our models, not for defining boundaries.\n","date":1142200432,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1142200432,"objectID":"530589af953146ca525acd4df03b44eb","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-3/","publishdate":"2006-03-12T21:53:52Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-3/","section":"posts","summary":"The central question I have been trying to satisfy myself about with these notes is the following: is there a way to formulate Intelligent Design as a scientific theory?

Here in part 2 I have exerpted from Behe\u0026rsquo;s book in order to summarize his argument. I am using the 2003 trade paperback edition published by Free Press, lent to me by a work colleague.\nThe ID argument in a nutshell:\n\u0026ldquo;For discrete physical systems \u0026mdash; if there is not a gradual route to their production \u0026mdash; design is evident when a number of separate, interacting components are ordered in such a way as to accomplish a function beyond the individual components.\u0026rdquo; (p. 194)\n\u0026ldquo;Because the functions depend critically on the intricate interactions of the parts we must conclude that they, like a mousetrap, were designed.\u0026rdquo; (p. 205)\nIn particular for the cilium, a system used by cells for movement:\n\u0026ldquo;The function of the cilium is to be a motorized paddle. In order to achieve this function microtubules, nexin linkers, and motor proteins all have to be ordered in a precise fashion. They have to recognize each other intimately, and interact exactly. The function is not present if any of the components is missing.\u0026rdquo; (p. 204) On the identity of the designer:\n\u0026ldquo;Inferences to design do not require that we have a candidate for the role of designer.\u0026rdquo; (p. 196) On the falsifiability of ID:\n\u0026ldquo;Might there be an as-yet-undiscovered natural process that would explain biochemical complexity? No one would be foolish enough to categorically deny the possibility. Nonetheless, we can say that if there is such a process, no one has a clue how it would work. Further, it would go against all human experience, like postulating that a natural process might explain computers. Concluding that no such process exists is as scientifically sound as concluding that mental telepathy is not possible, or that the Loch Ness monster doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. In the face of the massive evidence we do have for biochemical design, ignoring that evidence in the name of a phantom process would be to play the role of the detectives who ignore an elephant.\u0026rdquo; (p. 203-204) On the testability of ID:\n\u0026ldquo;Hypothesis, careful testing, replicability \u0026ndash; all these have served science well. But how can an intelligent designer be tested? Can a designer be put in a test tube? No, of course not. But neither can extinct common ancestors be put in test tubes. The problem is that whenever science tries to explain a unique historical event, careful testing and replicability are by definition impossible. Science may be able to study the motion of modern comets, and test Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws of motion that describe how the comets move. But science will never be able to study the comet that putatively struck the earth many millions of years ago. Science can, however, observe the comet\u0026rsquo;s lingering effects on the modern earth. Similarly, science can see the effects that a designer has had on life.\u0026rdquo; (emphasis in the original) (p. 242-243) ","date":1142199142,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1142199142,"objectID":"20d4a88cadd7526af734f6d791ce613a","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-2/","publishdate":"2006-03-12T21:32:22Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-2/","section":"posts","summary":"This is a continuation of my discussion of ID (see part 1).

I just finished reading Michael Behe\u0026rsquo;s book Darwin\u0026rsquo;s Black Box from 1996, and I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about it from the perspective of science, falsifiability, religion, and philosophy. I would like to be very careful about where I plan and do not plan to take issue with him, so let me start in Part 1 by delineating the argument.\nFirst of all, the eponymous designer of ID need not be divine, says Behe, and I agree completely. It could be an alien species, or something way beyond our understanding, but non-divine. ID is not inherently theological. So this discussion will have nothing whatsoever to do with God or religion. Religious folks may want ID to become a political movement so they can impose their views into everyone\u0026rsquo;s lives, but that is the problem of those religious folks, and does not bear on ID\u0026rsquo;s validity.\nSecondly, I will not contest any of Behe\u0026rsquo;s descriptions of various biochemical systems. The cilium, blood clotting, etc., are all assumed to work the way he describes, including the \u0026ldquo;irreducible complexity\u0026rdquo; of these systems (more on that in later parts, of course).\nWe both agree, further, that the earth is 5 billion years old, that Darwinian evolution does in fact take place in many domains (including the descent of man from a common ancestor with apes, the origin of new species, all that good stuff). ID does not deny these things, so we needn\u0026rsquo;t discuss them.\nWe both reject the counterargument to ID that goes like this: If an intelligent designer designed our cilia, or our blood clotting system, or our eyes, then he could have made them more efficient/effective/symmetric/beautiful or whatever, and so they were not designed. This argument requires an understanding of the motivation of the designer, as well as a claim to completely understand all the tradeoffs involved in the functioning of these systems, which no one has. We will not be discussing this argument further.\nAny new scientific theory will be treated with skepticism, and ID touches religious nerves which makes this an especially complicated issue to deal with. I am not going to make the mistake of dismissing ID based on my own concerns about the political ramifications, or the granting of power to religious interests. I am attempting to understand Behe\u0026rsquo;s arguments on his terms. I want to know whether ID can be a truly testable, falsifiable scientific theory that stands on its own. I want to understand this because if it passes this test, then I invite it to be taught in science classrooms. If it fails this test, then I will join the fight to keep it out of the science classroom, where it can do no good and can do quite a bit of harm.\nA few further clarifications are in order. I am not making the assumption that science is a good system. I am not requiring you to agree that science enhances our sense of wonder and of the divine. I do not claim that scientists are automatically benevolent, or are smarter than anyone else. I am not claiming that scientists should be the sole trustees of ethical decisions concerning technology. I am not trying to pass a value judgment on science itself, in other words. I may do so in future writings, but I am leaving it out of the discussion of ID. I am only studying a very narrow question:\n","date":1142197194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1142197194,"objectID":"2de2b2a83c8cae4afa7063ec77daa863","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-1/","publishdate":"2006-03-12T20:59:54Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-1/","section":"posts","summary":"I am finally ready to write some definitive thoughts about Intelligent Design.

A major theme of the movie is that the goals of science and religion are so hard to untangle that the two main protagonists have a very complicated adult relationship based on it.\nIn the current context of the debate about religion in the science classroom, I think about my own feelings about science quite a bit. Far from feeling that science and religion are incompatible, I actually feel that they are two sides of the same coin. I mean, think about it. How often do people\u0026rsquo;s deeply held, innermost core beliefs actually tend to be different? Can we really believe that, given the size of the universe (which I guess you\u0026rsquo;ll have to grant me) and all the diversity of our planet, that two of us humans could really be all that tremendously different in our innermost models of what our purpose is in the universe?

In particular, I wish that some religious representatives would realize that pursuing science is a way of appreciating the Universe, or God, or Nature, or whatever Large Thing you care to call it. If God did create the Universe, why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t he want us to understand all the wonders he created? Is it sinful to break apart an atom and see what God made inside the atom? Far from it, it\u0026rsquo;s an expression of wonder to pursue such knowledge. If you interviewed all the scientists who do stuff like that, you\u0026rsquo;d find many or most of them are on a search for something larger than themselves, a way to be connected to the Universe.

I have always felt very strongly about the dangers faced by science in our society, and this crisis is a perfect example of what can happen without careful vigilance on the part of science teachers and practitioners.\nI will be trying to understand this issue thoroughly in the coming months, though I must admit my conclusion is rather clear in advance. Nonetheless, I believe there are subtle arguments being made in ID, and if I am truly worried about the role of science in my society, then I owe it to my children to understand the debate completely, so that I can be an informed participant in any future discussions that involve my district.\nThe main themes I\u0026rsquo;ll be keeping in mind as I read are: is ID a purely religious point of view? Is ID a \u0026ldquo;God of the Gaps\u0026rdquo; argument? Can a falsifiable scientific theory of ID exist? Are our children being taught that science produces facts rather than theories? Are our children being taught that science and religion cannot coexist?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be getting to these questions over time. At the moment, I want to say something about science to get the ball rolling. Science is many things, but right now I feel especially protective of its adherence to falsifiability. Any scientific statement or prediction must be testable against nature, and such tests must be able to either confirm or contradict the statement. When Einstein proposed the theory of General Relativity, it was known right away that its predictions of the movement of bodies did not vary very much from the Newtonian formulation of gravity. If Einstein had been unable to think of an experiment or observation that would be able to confirm or contradict his theory with respect to Newton\u0026rsquo;s, then the scientific community would have rejected General Relativity completely. Einstein and Sir Arthur Eddington were able, however, to use GR to predict an observed anomoly in the orbit of Mercury that had previously gone unexplained. Moreover, they were able to use GR to predict the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, and observe such lensing during a solar eclipse. Once these observations were made and proved to be consistent with GR to great precision, GR became the new working theory of gravity. If we make an observation tomorrow that is inconsistent with GR, and in some sense we already have because quantum theory is known to be incompatible, then we will start looking for a better theory that explains everything explained by GR and also the inconsistent observations. Science does not hold any given theory dear, and each one is always ready to be rejected as soon as it fails. The system only works if falsifiability is held as the highest goal. Skepticism, peer review, and measurements against nature are the tools of science.\nNow let me extend this idea to science class. We should teach only scientific theories in science class. This means two things. First, no non-falsifiable theories need apply. Those are not testable by science, and so they lie outside the domain. They are as irrelevant in science class as anything can be. It would be the same as requiring students to learn to tell fortunes with Tarot cards in history class. Secondly, we must be very careful in how we teach science. I suspect that many teachers do not give students the impression that scientific theories can be overthrown, or how that happens. Rather, they teach theories as if they were final facts. Gravity is the curvature of spacetime. Electrons do orbit the nucleus in fixed orbitals that are physically real. Galaxies definitely have black holes at the center. The universe definitely started with the Big Bang. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that every sentence like these needs to be qualified with \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;, we think\u0026rdquo; every time you say them, so long as you spend a good amount of class time explaining that everything is just a working model. Science does not claim that the world really works in certain ways. Rather, it is a process for better modeling the world, and it requires certain criteria in order for the forward movement to continue.\nSo, if ID is not falsifiable, that\u0026rsquo;s the only piece of information I need to decide if it should be taught in science class. Others like to discuss how religious Newton was, or how uncertain of natural selection so-and-so actual practiciing biologist is. None of this matters. Every falsifiable theory of biology that explains all the known facts should be taught in science class, and nothing more. If someone says \u0026ldquo;God created some of our biochemical machinery,\u0026rdquo; then I\u0026rsquo;m very interested to hear their argument, but not in science class. It can never be proved wrong, because we will never know what actually happened in the past, and so it gets science nowhere.\n","date":1128895228,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1128895228,"objectID":"e65614b05aafd8b20fc5526f334d2d2e","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2005-10-09-irrational-design/","publishdate":"2005-10-09T22:00:28Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2005-10-09-irrational-design/","section":"posts","summary":"There is a great deal of controversy at the moment over Intelligent Design (ID) being taught in science classrooms.

Sometimes these same people are also very skeptical of Microsoft, but usually not. It\u0026rsquo;s strange, though, that someone can feel so ambivalent about Microsoft yet so strongly negative about the Mac. Recently, the success of the iPod has served to greatly increase the bitterness and spite felt towards the Mac by such people.\nAnyway, since I\u0026rsquo;m often asked at work, \u0026ldquo;Why do you love the Mac so much,\u0026rdquo; I decided to try to answer it. I am unable to give detailed reasons on the spot, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d keep it in the back of my mind, and blog about it when something occurred to me. Besides, most of my reasons are very mundane and subtle interface design issues that sort of accumulate in my mind into a positive feeling over time. When one of these small things happens, rather than let it fall through the cracks, I hoped to catch it for a segment I call \u0026ldquo;Mac Moments.\u0026rdquo;\nBefore proceeding to the Moment, let me add that I am also a heavy user of Windows and Linux. There are great things about all three platforms, and I\u0026rsquo;m a competent user of all of them. I own a fast PC because I like playing the latest games, which is the same reason I own an Xbox and a GameCube. I don\u0026rsquo;t hate Windows, in fact I think I have the most balanced opinion on the pros and cons of these systems of anyone I know! But of course, look who\u0026rsquo;s telling me that. Okay, I hope that addressed any fears you may have had that I\u0026rsquo;m a serious Mac zealot. On to the Moment!\nMy first Mac Moment is very small.\nIn the Mac OS, when you Command-click on the titlebar of a window that\u0026rsquo;s not in the foreground, you can move that window around without bringing it forward.\nIn my case, there was a progress dialog for a movie file I was processing in the background, and I was working in a text editor in the foreground. I wanted to slide it to the right a bit in order to see more of the progress bar, so I could monitor the progress while I worked. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to bring the whole movie application forward, I only wanted to move a background window. On the Mac, I\u0026rsquo;m able to perform this common, mundane task. On Windows, there is no such thing as modified clicks on window frames. Any click will bring the window forward. In the worst case, this can be expensive, causing a redraw of the window as it comes forward, and then another redraw when you switch back to what you were doing. Moreover, if you were working in Word or a text editor like I was, the click to bring your work back to the front might move the cursor from where you were working, forcing you to reposition it.\nLike I said, this is a small issue. But over the course of years, you come to appreciate the extra thought that went into the Mac. A Windows user typically doesn\u0026rsquo;t even recognize that this sort of user-centric way of working even exists.

No one I talk to has a clear idea of when and why it was invented. What country started it? What countries adhere to it? Why is Europe still doing it a week before the US?\nIt seems clear to me that having extremely accurate measurements of time has become an indispensible part of our society. Computers and many other timekeeping devices are synchronized regularly with servers maintained by (or synchronized with) our standards bodies\u0026rsquo; equipment, so that their inherent inaccuracy can be overcome. Very nearly, there is one nearly standard idea of time.\nWhy, then, do we have this sloppy period where times start changing all over the world. At the company where I work, we have employees everywhere with whom we meet regularly by phone. One of them works from Morocco, and we missed a meeting with him last week because he had already gone to daylight savings time and we hadn\u0026rsquo;t, and we all forgot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not so much that this really bothers me, because I don\u0026rsquo;t care if we have a somewhat loose notion of time \u0026amp;emdash; when we make it too strict, I start to feel a bit dehumanized. Rather, what I find interesting is that we\u0026rsquo;re so inconsistent. We seem obsessed with the exact microsecond of time, and we do all we can to get univeral agreement among our devices, at least locally, while at the same time we don\u0026rsquo;t keep very good track of the hours.\nAll this was an overly elaborate way to link to a CNN story (via Slashdot) about Congress considering extending Daylight Savings Time by a couple of months. That would make eight months of DST out of twelve. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t that sound strange? It drives home how arbitrary time is anyway \u0026ndash; why not call the other four months \u0026ldquo;Daylight Wastings Time\u0026rdquo;? When I saw the headline mention changing DST, I assumed they were trying to do away with it! I assumed that the confusion and loss of maximal human efficiency caused by the change would be declared to be a drag on our economy or something.\nOf course, there are reasons it seems DST is a good idea. I guess it saves energy to move the daylight hours around. That\u0026rsquo;s all fine and good, but do it everywhere in the world at once, or else let\u0026rsquo;s just admit we don\u0026rsquo;t really care what time it is.\n","date":1112937395,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1112937395,"objectID":"3f0be994b86a9ce2353479cc70099686","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2005-04-08-daylight-savings-time/","publishdate":"2005-04-08T05:16:35Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2005-04-08-daylight-savings-time/","section":"posts","summary":"I don\u0026rsquo;t understand daylight savings time.

S. Lewis collection. I felt like progressing on with his Christian works, and so I chose Mere Christianity.\nIn this book, there are good, simple explanations of many points of Christian doctrine that I rarely heard explained in Catholic school. Without fully admitting it to myself, however, I was looking for something specific. Namely, I was looking for more material like that which I found to be compelling in The Great Divorce, describing what it might be like to really surrender to a certain impulse. In Lewis\u0026rsquo; mind this is the religious, specifically Christian impulse, to be one with God. In my mind, I\u0026rsquo;d rather not say it\u0026rsquo;s religious, but yet I know exactly what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about. I am familiar with trying to improve myself, and also with failing to do so. I am familiar with many doubts and fears, and I also perceive that it is possible to defeat all of these with a single choice. That choice is simply to give them up and stop having the doubts and fears. The funny thing is, though, that we don\u0026rsquo;t want to give them up. We feel very possessive of these feelings because they are part of our identity. I enjoy very much reading about this idea, because it gives me glimpses into what life might be like after such a surrender.\nOne point he makes that stood out for me is in the chapter called \u0026ldquo;Is Christianity Hard or Easy?\u0026rdquo; Lewis describes a misconception, which I can relate to. The misconception is that we sometimes feel like obeying morality is something we hope we can do some of, and then when we\u0026rsquo;re done, there will be time left over for ourselves, to do the things we want to do. Not evil things, just things that aren\u0026rsquo;t so wrapped up with morality, like watching a movie, say. We hold back that little piece; our own personal agenda is more important, but we will try to make decisions consistant with our moral code \u0026ldquo;some of the time.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a simple observation, but I just don\u0026rsquo;t hear about other people feeling this way anywhere else. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine why not, because if Lewis is right, we all feel the same way. Maybe the non-religious point of view in fashion in the world today is that if you fail to live up to morals, then you\u0026rsquo;ve just plain failed, so we all give it up. There\u0026rsquo;s no real acknowledgment in the society I live in that this failure is to be taken for granted, and that you then have to decide how to proceed. This theme is central to Mere Christianity, and I think it deserves a lot of thought, but I still suspect you can separate it from the religious aspects.\nI suppose it\u0026rsquo;s not too surprising that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been exposed to this train of thought, because I read mainly fiction, and watch movies and some television. I don\u0026rsquo;t do a lot of nonfiction reading, outside of these Lewis books. Maybe I should broaden that horizon a bit.\nOne final point. I\u0026rsquo;m playing both sides of the fence in these entries about Lewis. I\u0026rsquo;m very accepting of his ideas, and clearly I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find deep truths here. But at the same time, I reserve the right not to be thought of as religious! I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought the details through, but I believe I can accept these truths without linking them with God, and especially not with Jesus. I think these are psychological ideas, and many of the concepts of morality are societal ones. My firm belief is that all of this can be looked at with or without God, but that the decision as to which is very important. But it is still a decision. It may not be arbitrary for every person, i.e. for some people maybe only one side makes sense. But I believe in this \u0026ldquo;freedom to choose.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1105925980,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1105925980,"objectID":"b77772ccc3f68691b4503dc6988fd3d9","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2005-01-17-c-s-lewis-2005/","publishdate":"2005-01-17T01:39:40Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2005-01-17-c-s-lewis-2005/","section":"posts","summary":"I visited my parents for the holidays again this year, and like last year I decided to read some of their C.

The power of Evil he describes, and the inevibatle comparisons to the horror of World War I make this a convincing point of view. The army of Gondor is forced to risk a suicidal attack against a formidable foe to even preserve their tiny ghost of a chance of victory.\nMore than this, the mood of the work is very bleak. The larger story arc about the Elves that includes The Silmarillion is in Elrond\u0026rsquo;s words a story about \u0026ldquo;fighting the long defeat.\u0026rdquo; The defeat of Sauron, a minor lieutenant of the world\u0026rsquo;s great evil, Melkor, means the end of the Elves\u0026rsquo; rings of power and their final flight into the West, having finally failed to \u0026ldquo;make a go of it\u0026rdquo; in Middle Earth.\nEven Frodo\u0026rsquo;s victory is bittersweet. His path to redemption was to press on through despair and hopelessness, and in the process receive deep spiritual wounds that would never heal. In the end, he has to forsake the Shire and leave Middle Earth as well. This is not really a happy ending, in the sense of Good people living happily ever after.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t really say I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my mind, but reflecting on the book recently reminded me that there are definitely a few moments where Tolkien is saying something else, and I wanted to share them. These are small quotes from the books (in fact, all three are from The Return of the King and didn\u0026rsquo;t make it into the movie). I\u0026rsquo;ll present the context and the quotes, then indicate why I thought they are optimistic (though I think they\u0026rsquo;re quite crystal clear).\nWhen referring to chapters of The Lord of the Rings, I believe it\u0026rsquo;s customary to use notation like VI.1, meaning Book 6, Chapter 1. Recall that each of the three novels is divided into two Books each, for a total of 6.\nIn Chapter V.2, the orcs are attacking Minas Tirith. The orcs bring Grond, the giant battering ram, and bash the main gate open. The chief of the Nazgul, the Witch King of Angmar, rides through the gate to take the first level of the city, but finds Gandalf on Shadowfax, who challenges him. This is a bleak moment for Gondor, when the military might of Sauron has utterly defeated the city. The Nazgul replies:\nGandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away beyond in some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.\nAnd as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin\u0026rsquo;s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.\nIn chapter VI.1 Frodo has been taken prisoner by the orcs after they find him wrapped in Shelob\u0026rsquo;s web. The orcs defeated, Sam and Frodo are discussing how to get some food, and Sam wonders out loud whether orcs eat poison rather than real food. Frodo replies:\nIn the next chapter, VI.2, when Sam and Frodo are hunkering down for the night, Sam looks up:\nThe first and third quote are quite similar. In both, events outside the context of the story\u0026rsquo;s characters remind the reader (and the characters) that all their important doings are taking place in a larger world, one where the battle against Sauron is a small matter. It is a small matter because that outside world is essentially Good. In both cases, it is a form of natural beauty that calls attention to itself, and I think Tolkien is using this beauty to indicate the Goodness of the universe.\nThe middle quote, Frodo\u0026rsquo;s remark about how Sauron can mock but not make, is drawing a distinction between God and Satan, I think. Tolkien believes there is an inherent power in Good that cannot be duplicated by Evil. This is a tenet of faith, a religious point of view, that makes Sauron\u0026rsquo;s defeat more of an inevitability. Note that I can\u0026rsquo;t reconcile this idea with the fact that Sauron forges a powerful ring, an act of creation that holds real meaning because it can only be undone with great difficulty.\nUpdate: Two of the above scenes (the first and third) now appear in the Extended Edition release of the movie version of The Return of the King. The movie version of the first scene is missing the element I\u0026rsquo;m highlighting here, namely the crowing of the cock. Also, this same scene has the Witch King breaking Gandalf\u0026rsquo;s staff, which is inferior to the more mental struggle I think is portrayed in the text. The movie version of the third moment, where Sam sees the star in the sky, is changed only in that Sam points the star out to Frodo and shares his thoughts. I was very glad this was inserted in the Extended Edition, and there is even a companion moment where Frodo and Sam see an old king\u0026rsquo;s statue briefly lit by the sun with a wreath of flowers for a crown \u0026ndash; a similar image of hope.\n","date":1086058489,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1086058489,"objectID":"75bef2ecc3d25c4ec709570ceff9ef79","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2004-06-01-does-tolkien-think-good-always-defeats-evil/","publishdate":"2004-06-01T02:54:49Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2004-06-01-does-tolkien-think-good-always-defeats-evil/","section":"posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought Tolkien was essentially pessimistic, despite the happy ending of The Lord of the Rings.

RSS feeds are little XML files published by sites alongside the web pages with the actual content. As an example, here is a link to one of the many RSS feeds published by the BBC (covering, in this case, just their European news).\nWhen RSS was invented, the feeds were meant to allow easy syndication into those little customizable boxes on portal pages like Netscape and Yahoo.

Of course, you don\u0026rsquo;t read the XML itself, rather the XML contains information like a headline, a link to the full story, and a brief summary. The headlines and summaries let you skip over everything that doesn\u0026rsquo;t interest you, and in that way it\u0026rsquo;s become my main tool for coping with information overload.\nCircularly, RSS feeds and aggregators are the \u0026ldquo;other half\u0026rdquo; of the blog system itself: every blog engine (Blogger.com, Movable Type, Radio, etc.) publishes an RSS feed file that is kept in sync with the blog.

S. Lewis: The Great Divorce, The Screwtape Letters and Surprised by Joy.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been introduced to Lewis before, when I was young. I read the first several books of the Narnia series, and I read the whole Out of the Silent Planet trilogy. Back then, however, I was looking for pure entertainment from those books, and although they delivered it, the religious level was also apparent, and detracted from their enjoyment for me.\nI came back to Lewis through Tolkien, having read The Lord of the Rings several times now and wondering a bit about how much religion to look for in it. Lewis and Tolkien were friends and colleagues, and I knew Lewis wrote religious works, so I was hoping to gain insight into Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s religious side this way. So, this time around I was looking for the religious content, and curious about how Lewis approached it. I chose works that I was told were good examples of his religious writing.\nI found that he emphasizes all the aspects of Christianity that I find most comforting. In fact, one of Lewis\u0026rsquo; central ideas in The Great Divorce suggests the sort of therapy we could all use. In this allegorical story, the visitors to Heaven must let go of things that make life on earth more like Hell: an attachment to unhappiness and to fear. To hold onto these things, and use them for nourishment instead of their opposites, leads not to safety and peace (since to my mind they are intended as protection against hurt) but to a bland and bleak life, empty and devoid of beauty. To make this trade-off is not only foolish, it is Lewis\u0026rsquo; definition of Hell.\nLetting go of fear and anger, however, seems to me to be an issue on a psychological level, not a religious one. And I kept feeling this disconnect throughout all three books, as well as during a recent re-reading of Out of the Silent Planet. The real lessons kept seeming very earthly to me, suggesting attitude adjustments that could take place in the here and now, under one\u0026rsquo;s own power.\nAlmost like a self-help book, Lewis seemed to be instructing us about joy, something I think everyone already has a fully fleshed-out idea of, if only by contradiction to their own disappointments in life. He never draws a very convincing connection between this freedom from fear and God or Jesus. At one point in Surprised by Joy, which chronicles his own conversion in adulthood, Lewis, having tapped into a realization of God\u0026rsquo;s existence, and having learned how to let go and stop grasping at false images of happiness, he then began to \u0026ldquo;shop around\u0026rdquo; for a religion:\nThen, a few sentences later, after having rejected Hinduism as \u0026ldquo;coexistence of philosophy side by side with Paganism unpurged\u0026rdquo; he says of Christianity,\nLewis is a renowned Christian writer, and I am not dismissing his ability to explain or shore up the ideas of Christianity. The point I\u0026rsquo;m making is that when I read these three books, I did not find a very strong explanation of why Christianity and faith must play a role in setting the moral and psychological tone of one\u0026rsquo;s life.\nI also did not find evidence either way as to whether The Lord of the Rings is a Christian work.\nWhat I did find, however, was an excellent and inspiring account of the choice that one must make to be happy. In a way, happiness is the choice to be happy, and Lewis provides very insightful and persuasive images of what it means to make that choice, and why it is so easy to decide the opposite instead.\n","date":1082235608,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1082235608,"objectID":"87292349504b97b8530dba6e7f4dc459","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2004-04-17-book-review-c-s-lewis/","publishdate":"2004-04-17T21:00:08Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2004-04-17-book-review-c-s-lewis/","section":"posts","summary":"This winter I read three books by C.

By way of Mac hardware, I own an aging 1999 Powerbook, and I have no plans to buy another Mac. In fact, any serious gamer must automatically reject the Mac.\nGames played on computers remain of a different character than those you find on consoles, and include genres that will never be appropriate on a console, especially real-time strategy games (Warcraft, Rise of Nations, etc.). If you want to play real-time strategy games, you need Windows, though, because the best games are not available on the Mac. Apple would have you believe that the cream of the crop gets ported to Mac, and this is true for Warcraft, but in general it\u0026rsquo;s an unfair overstatement. Rise of Nations is a superb game, and its absence from the Mac pretty much makes the Mac a non-viable gaming platform. There are many more examples of top-flight games that never get ported than do. Half-Life and Grim Fandango, where were those? And most of the smaller games that flesh out the offerings on PC have no hope of being ported.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not enough to port games six months later, either, because the marketing reality is that games, like movies, are partially about hype and a buildup in the press. Mainstream gaming sites like Gamespy and Gamespot cover PC games as they\u0026rsquo;re released for Windows. If the Mac is not supported on release day, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, except for people who have to wait anyway.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a truism in the PC world that great new games drive hardware sales. That means that the Windows platform has a beneficial symbiotic relationship with games that the Mac is missing out on. This holds the Mac market back, and throttles enthusiasm for new hardware. Instead, Apple tries to dole out upgrade enthusiasm by releasing cool new products. This can never work, because of the inherent interest Apple has in selling hardware. People need their own independent reasons for wanting new hardware, other than the release of the hardware itself. Marketing can\u0026rsquo;t work in a vacuum.\nFrustrated Mac-heads will read the above and immediately point out that there is a frustrating catch-22 in the lack of a games market: companies won\u0026rsquo;t invest the resources in porting games unless the Mac market is big. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;m saying the Mac market is going to remain small unless there are more games. This is true, but Apple isn\u0026rsquo;t doing anything about it and they should.\nMicrosoft is also a game studio, and makes high-quality games for PC and the XBox. They did this buy buying existing game studios and fuelling them with cash and resources. Apple should consider doing the same thing, but with porting houses. Maybe they can even convince studios to write games cross-platform from the beginning, the way Blizzard does. If they can help with some tools that make it easy to make these conversions, that would go a long way towards subsidizing a larger games market.\nNote that I\u0026rsquo;m not knocking the legacy of excellent Mac-only or Mac-first games. Ambrosia and LittleWing spring to mind because I have enjoyed their games over the years. Shareware games are not really under discussion here because they don\u0026rsquo;t have a major impact on the platform\u0026rsquo;s market share the way million-copy-selling games do.\n","date":1063157757,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1063157757,"objectID":"2ae27d583cd03bb190f53037c3b210cc","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2003-09-10-mac-diatribe-lack-of-games/","publishdate":"2003-09-10T01:35:57Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2003-09-10-mac-diatribe-lack-of-games/","section":"posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a serious gamer, just below the rank of what the press call \u0026ldquo;hardcore.\u0026rdquo; I own an XBox, a GameBoy, and a very fast PC.

We construct a mathematical framework for twisted N=2 supersymmetric topological quantum field theory on a 4-manifold. Supersymmetry in flat space is defined and the twist homomorphism is constructed, giving us a supermanifold that is the total space of an odd vector bundle over the even 4-manifold. A special category of connections on this space is defined and a decomposition into so-called component fields is proved. The twisted supersymmetric action is computed, and the structure of the action, the decomposition, and the action of a special odd vector field are all shown to have a rich geometrical structure that was partially interpred by Atiyah and Jeffrey. [1] In short, the action is an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Euler class of the vector bundle of self-dual 2-forms over the space of connections mod gauge. This geometrical insight serves two purposes: first, it motivates the study of anti-self-dual connections, intersection theory, and the action of the group of gauge transformations, all of which appear by themselves after the twist. Secondly, it sets the stage for an eventual proof of Witten’s Conjecture, relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants. What we build here amounts to a mathematical treatment of a physical treatment [17] of a mathematical construction of Donaldson. [5], [4].\nIntroduction The primary goal of this paper is to present an alternative formulation of Donaldson theory [5], [4]. This will involve an exploration of supersymmetry and an important variation thereof. We will construct a very special eight-dimensional vector bundle S⁢X over a compact, closed, simply connected riemannian four-manifold X that is the direct descendent of N=2 supersymmetry in Euclidean space. We will examine the space of connections on a principal bundle over this space, building on results for connections over super Euclidean space. This space of connections comes equipped with a vector field, inherited from the supersymmetry algebra. The structure of the space together with the vector field is very rich and generalizes a beautiful finite dimensional geometrical picture. This geometry is further reflected in the action, a functional on superconnections that is the analog for S⁢X of a similar construct in super Euclidean space. What we gain from this framework is a set of algebraic tools that are geared to one purpose: doing intersection theory on the moduli space of anti-self-dual (ASD) connections modulo the group of gauge transformations. Without having introduced ASD connections, or requiring that we divide by the gauge group, we see that these objects and operations are natural in this supersymmetric context.\nThe secondary goal of this paper is discussed in the final section. Once we have seen that the Donaldson invariants fit into a supersymmetric quantum field theory framework, we can begin to address Witten’s Conjecture [18]. This is the famous unproven relationship between the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten ([14], [11]) invariants. Witten’s “proof” of this result used the celebrated breakthroughs he obtained with Seiberg [14] on N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in Minkowski space, just like the gauge theory we consider here in Euclidean space. We will see a brief sketch of their proof, and attempt to point the way that leads from this paper to a mathematical proof of their result. We hope to convince the reader that the enlargement of Donaldson’s picture presented here is the right place to begin to understand why Witten’s conjecture is true, and maybe why and how it was discovered in the first place.\nThe following outline of this document should aid the reader. Super Euclidean and super Minkowski space are made from spin bundles in four dimensions, so we present these objects and the necessary volume forms and metrics. Super Euclidean space is the first important object we will encounter. This superspace has a special framing that reflects the spin structure, and which we will use to construct component fields of superfields. This framing is the second focal point of this paper. Next we define a very specific category of connections over superspace, called semi-constrained. The semi-constrained condition comes from physics, where objects are defined in terms of a dimensional reduction from six dimensions to four. In short, fully constrained connections are required to be flat in the odd directions, whereas semi-constrained ones can have two independent nonvanishing components of curvature in odd directions. Semi-constrained connections form the third focal center for this work. To study them, we describe the approach taken in physics. That is, we construct and prove an isomorphism between superconnections and a different space, a product space of objects defined on the underlying even principal bundle and even four-manifold. We rely heavily on the framing we constructed to define these “component fields.” Finally, we put this all together and write down the N=2 superspace version of the Yang-Mills action, which involves all of the component fields.\nSection 2 repeats much of this discussion for the twisted picture. The twist is a representation theoretic operation on the two copies of spinors we have in N=2 supersymmetry, that turns spinors into constants, 1-forms, and self-dual 2-forms. It is here that self-duality enters for the first time, and it is directly from this isomorphism of representations that we are eventually led to consider the ASD equations. We construct analogues of material from Section 1: the eight-dimensional bundle is now well-defined on any riemannian 4-manifold; the eight odd vector fields that formed our framing become three odd vector fields with bundle values; superconnections retain the same definition, though the nonvanishing odd-odd curvatures are described differently; the component fields have a more elegant and intrinsic definition, though we are careful to recognize that each new component field can be rewritten in a coordinate patch as its flat space counterpart. Then we write down the action of one of the three odd vector fields on the space of superconnections. This action forms part of an infinite-dimensional analogue of a beautiful finite-dimensional construction, which we take up in Section 3. Section 3 is an introduction to two finite-dimensional geometrical constructions. The first is a special formula for the Thom class of a vector bundle, first constructed by Mathai and Quillen [10]. The second is a form on the total space of a principal bundle that allows integration of forms on the base to take place on the total space instead. Both constructions have an algebraic flavor that helped physicists connect with physics. We will see that the algebraic structure of both of these constructions is present on our 4-manifold in the form of: the space of superconnections, the action of the odd vector field, and the form of the twisted Yang-Mills action. This would be enough to prove the field theoretic formulas for the Donaldson polynomial invariants that we write down, but for the fact that there are no theorems along the geometrical lines that work in finite dimensions. However, we will prove the result another way, using formulas for linear and Gaussian path integrals that are formal but consistent with physical manipulations.\nFinally, in the last section we introduce the reader to the issues that led to this work, namely Witten’s Conjecture relating the Donaldson polynomial invariants to the Seiberg-Witten invariants. We will see that in the picture painted by modern physics, the quest for an easier formulation of the polynomial invariants is completely natural. The issue is that solving this problem is very hard. There is a physics proof, and any proper mathematical proof should address it, or at least parallel it. And so we are led to ask for a mathematical formulation of the physical formulation of the invariants, a need this paper is designed to address.\n1. Introduction to supersymmetry 1.1. A few super preliminaries A super vector space is a ℤ/2⁢ℤ-graded vector space\nV=V0⊕V1. The parity of an element v∈V, denoted π⁢(v), is 0 if v∈V0, in which case v is called even, and is 1 if v∈V1, in which case v is called odd. A morphism from V to W in this category is a grading-preserving linear transformation. The parity reversal of V, denoted Π⁢V is an isomorphism defined by\n(Π⁢V)0=V1 (Π⁢V)1=V0. Tensor products are defined using the tensor product of the underlying vector spaces, with grading given by\n(V⊗W)k=⊕i+j=kVi⊗Wj. The departure from simply defining a category of graded spaces comes with the definition of the commutativity isomorphism\nV⊗W→W⊗V which we define to send\n(1) v⊗w→(-1)π⁢(v)⁢π⁢(w)⁢w⊗v. If t1,…,tp is a basis for V0 and θ1,…,θq is a basis for V1, the commutative ℝ-algebra ℝ⁢[t1,…,tp,θ1,…,θq] is defined to be\nS*(t1,…,tp)⊗∧*(θ1,…θq). This should be thought of as a super version of the symmetric algebra on a vector space, where skew commutativity of the θi is part of the underlying properties of the odd generators. The space ℝp|q is defined as the topological space ℝp endowed with a sheaf C∞⁢(ℝp)⁢(θ1,…⁢θq) of commutative super ℝ-algebras, freely generated over the sheaf C∞⁢(ℝp) by the odd quantities θ1,…⁢θq. A super manifold M is a topological space with a sheaf of super ℝ-algebras, that is locally isomorphic to ℝp|q. The ideal generated by all odd functions on a supermanifold M defines an even submanifold we will denote by Meven, where we use the usual algebro-geometric correspondence between ideals and varieties given by the set of common zeros of the ideal.\nA morphism from a supermanifold S to ℝp|q can be identified with a set of p even functions and q odd functions on S. This definition can be worked up into a definition of maps between supermanifolds, and in particular to vector bundles and principal bundles. If 𝒫→M is a principal S⁢U⁢(2) bundle over a supermanifold M, with fiber given by the even space S⁢U⁢(2), then the restriction of this bundle to the even part Meven of M is a usual principal bundle we will consistently denote by P.\nIf E→M is a vector bundle over a supermanifold, with fiber isomorphic to ℝp|q, then there is another vector bundle we can form denoted Π⁢E→M, which is parity reversed on each fiber. In this case, the underlying even vector bundle has fiber isomorphic to ℝq, whereas the even vector bundle underlying E has fiber isomorphic to ℝp.\nThere is a concept of integration over odd variables called Berezinian integration. To compute ∫𝑑θ1⁢⋯⁢𝑑θn⁢f⁢(x1,…,xk,θ1,…,θl) we expand f into a power series in the θ directions and take the coefficient of θ1⁢⋯⁢θn,\n∫𝑑θ1⁢⋯⁢𝑑θn⁢f⁢(x1,…,xk,θ1,…,θl)=fi1⁢⋯⁢in⁢(x1,…,xk). As an application of super geometry we prove the following trivial, but crucial, isomorphism.\nLemma 1. Let X be an even manifold. Then C∞⁢(Π⁢T⁢X)≅Ω*⁢(X). Furthermore, there is a natural operator Q=∑iθi⁢∂xi∈C∞⁢(Π⁢T⁢X) and under the isomorphism we have Q≅d.\nProof. Let (x1,…,xn) be coordinates in a patch on X. Let (θ1,…,θn) be the induced coordinates in the odd ∂/∂⁡x1,…,∂/∂⁡xn directions of Π⁢T⁢X. Then the isomorphism is simply given by\nθi↦d⁢xi. ∎\n1.2. Super Euclidean space Consider two 2-dimensional complex vector spaces S+ and S-. From now on, we shall make use of the notation ± to make pairs of statements or definitions at once. Let\nε±:∧2S±→ℂ be fixed isomorphisms. These maps have adjoints\nad⁢(ε±):S±→(S±)* given by\nad⁢(ε±)⁢(s)=ε±⁢(s,⋅). The adjoint can be used to define the dual map\n(ε±)*:∧2(S±)*→ℂ by mapping\n(s1±,s2±)↦(s1±,ad⁢(ε±)-1⁢(s2±))↦s1±⁢(ad⁢(ε±)-1⁢(s2±)). Now we choose a basis {e+1,e+2} of S+, such that ε+⁢(e+1,e+2)=1. We also choose a basis {e-1,e-2} of S- such that ε-⁢(e-1,e-2)=1. We denote the dual basis by ei+ and ei-. One computes that\n(2) ad⁢(ε±)⁢(e±1) =e2± (3) ad⁢(ε±)⁢(e±2) =-e1± Also, for completeness we have\n(4) ad⁢(ε±)-1⁢(e1±) =-e±2 (5) ad⁢(ε±)-1⁢(e2±) =e±1 A final easy computation shows that with the above definition, (ε±)*⁢(e±1,e±2)=1.\nWe will build a four-dimensional complex vector space Vℂ with special properties. First of all, this space has two possible real structures, which we can use to construct Minkowski space and Euclidean space. Second of all, the action of Vℂ on S± by Clifford multiplication is “included” in the structure of Vℂ itself. We’ll see more of that shortly.\nWe define\nVℂ=(S+)*⊗(S-)*, and now our backward convention of denoting basis vectors with upper indices and dual vectors with lower indices should seem justified: Vℂ is built from dual spinors. Thus, elements of Vℂ have lower indices as expected and only the spinor spaces themselves have reversed index conventions. We equip Vℂ with the metric\n⟨,⟩=12(ε+)*⊗(ε-)* or in other words\n⟨s1+⊗s1-,s2+⊗s2-⟩=(ε+)*⁢(s1+,s2+)⋅(ε-)*⁢(s1-,s2-). To move towards defining a real subspace of Vℂ we note that we can define maps on spaces with the opposite complex structure,\n(ε±):opp∧2S±→oppℂ, by letting ε act normally on two elements, but then taking the complex conjugate of the result:\n(ε±)(a,b)opp=ε±⁢(a,b)¯. Now we introduce hermitian inner products h± on S±, which give isomorphisms\nh±:S±→(S±)*.opp We require that h± preserve the ε tensors, and so we can choose the bases e±i to be orthonormal.\nWe now use h± to define a real structure on Vℂ. Consider the map\nad⁢(ε+)-1⊗ad⁢(ε-)-1:(S+)*⊗(S-)*→S+⊗S- and compose it with the map\nh+⊗h-:S+⊗S-→(S+)*⊗opp(S-)*.opp Call this composition τ. One easily sees that τ is anti-ℂ-linear and that τ2 is the identity. We define V⊂Vℂ to be the set of fixed points of τ. Below we will see that V with the metric ⟨,⟩ is in fact Euclidean 4-space, E4.\nIt is appropriate to mention the variation of the above construction that leads to Minkowski space. First, we begin by setting S-=(S+).opp In other words, S- and S+ are opposite representations of S⁢L⁢(2,ℂ). We define ε-=(ε+)opp, i.e. ε-⁢(a,b)=ε+⁢(a,b)¯. We define τ to be the anti-ℂ-linear map exchanging S- and S+, which is the identity on the underlying vector spaces, but which reverses the complex structure. The fixed set of τ is Minkowski space M4, with the indefinite metric of signature (3,1).\nLet us discuss a permanent change of notation. Instead of denoting elements of S- with minus subscripts, we will place bars over them and place dots over their indices. Therefore, in the new notation a basis for S- is denoted {e¯1˙,e¯2˙}. The dual elements have lower indices. Note that the bars and dots do not indicate complex conjugate. This awkward-seeming notation is useful to make contact with the published physics literature, where Minkowski space is usually the context, and as we just saw the elements of S- are the conjugates of corresponding elements from S+.\nBecause we are translating parts of the physics literature into mathematics, we will have to make extensive use of index notation. So we need abbreviations for certain frequent notation. For example, we will denote the induced basis on the space S+⊗S+ by the four elements ea⁢b=e+a⊗e+b. A basis of the space (S+)*⊗S+ is given by elements eba=eb+⊗e+a. As a final example, a basis of the space (S+)*⊗(S-)*≅Vℂ is given by ea⁢b˙=ea+⊗eb-.\nLemma 2. ⟨,⟩:V⊗V→ℂ is real and positive definite.\nProof. Define the following basis of Vℂ=(S+)*⊗(S-)*:\nv1 = e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙ (6) v2 = i⁢e1⁢1˙-i⁢e2⁢2˙ v3 = e1⁢2˙-e2⁢1˙ v4 = i⁢e1⁢2˙+i⁢e2⁢1˙. Direct computation shows that this basis is real, and that in this basis ⟨,⟩ is the identity matrix. ∎\nDefinition 1. E4|4 is the subspace V×Π⁢((S+)*⊕(S-)*)⊂VC×Π⁢((S+)*⊕(S-)*).\nNote that the base V is real, while the fibers do not have a real structure.\nThe automorphism group of (S±,ε±,h±) is S⁢U⁢(2), and so S⁢U⁢(2)×S⁢U⁢(2) acts by isometries on Vℂ. This action leaves τ invariant and so preserves V, identifying S⁢U⁢(2)×S⁢U⁢(2) with the spin double cover of S⁢O⁢(4).\n1.2.1. Clifford multiplication The special definition of Vℂ makes describing Clifford multiplication particularly easy. The action\nVℂ⊗S+→S- is given by\n(S+)*⊗(S-)*⊗S+⁢→ev⁢(S-)*⁢⟶ad⁢(ε-)-1⁢S-, where the first map is evaluation on the S+ factors. The action of Vℂ on S- is given by a similar composition\n(S+)*⊗(S-)*⊗S-→(S+)*→S+. These actions induce an action of the whole Clifford algebra C⁢l⁢(Vℂ) on S+⊕S-, as one can easily check. This boils down to checking that acting with v twice gives multiplication by -∥v∥2.\nLemma 3. Clifford multiplication induces isomorphisms Vℂ ≅(S-)*⊗S+ ℂ⊕∧+2Vℂ ≅(S+)*⊗S+. Proof. The first isomorphism is given explicitly by\n(7) v1↦-e1˙2+e2˙1v2↦-i⁢e1˙2-i⁢e2˙1v3↦-e2˙2-e1˙1v4↦-i⁢e2˙2+i⁢e1˙1 which uses the definition of the vi together with (4) and (5).\nTo prove the second isomorphism we compute as follows. Compute multiplication by v1⋅v2 (meaning multiply by v2 and then multiply the result by v1) with\nv1⋅v2⋅e+m=v1⋅ad⁢(ε-)-1⁢((i⁢e1⁢1˙-i⁢e2⁢2˙)⁢(e+m))=v1⋅ad⁢(ε-)-1⁢(i⁢δ1m⁢e1--i⁢δ2m⁢e2-)=v1⋅(-i⁢δ1m⁢e-2-i⁢δ2m⁢e-1)=ad⁢(ε+)-1⁢((e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙)⁢(-i⁢δ1m⁢e-2-i⁢δ2m⁢e-1))=ad⁢(ε+)-1⁢(-i⁢δ1m⁢e2+-i⁢δ2m⁢e1+)=-i⁢δ1m⁢e+1+i⁢δ2m⁢e+2=i⁢(-1)m⁢e+m. Doing the calculation for v3⋅v4 yields an identical result, and so using the relationship between wedge product and Clifford product, we have computed that\nv1∧v2+v3∧v4↦(-i00i). One similarly obtains the rest of the maps\n(1,0) ↦ (1001) (0,v1∧v2+v3∧v4) ↦ (-i00i) (0,v1∧v3-v2∧v4) ↦ (01-10) (0,v1∧v4+v2∧v3) ↦ (0-i-i0). Noting that Hom⁢(S+,S+)≅(S+)*⊗S+, we represent this as\n(8) (1,0)↦e11+e22(0,v1∧v2+v3∧v4)↦-i⁢e11+i⁢e22(0,v1∧v3-v2∧v4)↦e21-e12(0,v1∧v4+v2∧v3)↦-i⁢e21-i⁢e12. The second isomorphism is now clear. This completes the proof. ∎\nThe spaces Vℂ and ℂ⊕∧+2Vℂ have obvious real subrepresentations, a fact that will be important when we twist.\nFor later use, we provide a version of (8) with lowered indices, using (2), (3) (the raised index becomes the first lower index since (S+)* is the first factor).\n(9) (1,0)↦e21-e12(0,v1∧v2+v3∧v4)↦-i⁢e21-i⁢e12(0,v1∧v3-v2∧v4)↦e22+e11(0,v1∧v4+v2∧v3)↦-i⁢e22+i⁢e11. 1.2.2. Invariant vector fields The remainder of this section follows [9].\nWe define a coordinate system on E4|4 as follows. Using the orthonormal basis elements of S+, S-, and V given above we define coordinate functions θa and θ¯a˙ on (S+)* and (S-)* respectively (a and a˙ take on values 1 or 2). On V we use coordinates that we denote by ya⁢b˙ (again, each index takes on the values 1 or 2). So we have explicitly\n(10) θa⁢(eb) =δba (11) θ¯(e¯)b˙a˙ =δb˙a˙ (12) ya⁢b˙⁢(ec⁢d˙) =δca⁢δd˙b˙. We denote differentiation in the θa and θ¯a˙ direction by ∂a and ∂¯a˙ respectively. We denote differentiation in the ya⁢b˙ direction by ∂a⁢b˙. We define\nDa = ∂a-θ¯∂a⁢b˙b˙ D¯a˙ = ∂¯a˙-θb⁢∂b⁢a˙ and\nQa = ∂a+θ¯∂a⁢b˙b˙ Q¯a˙ = ∂¯a˙+θb⁢∂b⁢a˙. These vector fields satisfy the bracket relations (remembering that for two odd vector fields you add instead of subtract to form brackets)\n[Da,Db] =[D¯,a˙D¯]b˙=0 [Da,D¯]b˙ =-2⁢∂a⁢b˙ and\n[Qa,Qb] =[Q¯,a˙Q¯]b˙=0 [Qa,Q¯]b˙ =2⁢∂a⁢b˙. 1.2.3. E4|8 Simply put, N=2 super Euclidean space, also called E4|8, has two copies of Π⁢((S+)*⊕(S-)*) instead of one. We don’t need to repeat the above discussion, but there are some complications. First of all, we need to provide the odd coordinate functions and vector fields with another index, that can take on the values 1 or 2, to represent which copy of Π⁢((S+)*⊕(S-)*) they live on. So, we now have the odd coordinate functions\nθ1⁢(1),θ2⁢(1),θ¯1˙⁢(1),θ¯2˙⁢(1),θ1⁢(2),θ2⁢(2),θ¯1˙⁢(2),θ¯2˙⁢(2) as well as the left-invariant vector fields\nD1(1),D2(1),D¯,1˙(1)D¯D1(2)2˙(1),D2(2),D¯,1˙(2)D¯,2˙(2) Q1(1),Q2(1),Q¯,1˙(1)Q¯Q1(2)2˙(1),Q2(2),Q¯,1˙(2)Q¯.2˙(2) The commutation relations are the same as before, with brackets of vector fields of differing upper index vanishing:\n[Da(i),Db(j)] = [D¯,a˙(i)D¯]b˙(j)=0 (13) [Da(i),D¯]b˙(j) = -2⁢δi⁢j⁢∂a⁢b˙ and\n[Qa(i),Qb(j)] = [Q¯,a˙(i)Q¯]b˙(j)=0 (14) [Qa(i),Q¯]b˙(j) = 2⁢δi⁢j⁢∂a⁢b˙. To sum up the index structure of these vector fields we make the following remark.\nObservation 1. The Q’s and D’s are sections of the 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4)×S⁢U⁢(2)-bundle (S+)*⊗C2 and the Q¯’s and D¯’s are sections of the 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4)×S⁢U⁢(2)-bundle (S-)*⊗C2.\n1.3. Gauge theory on E4|8 Much of this section can be considered “standard material” and can be found in the literature. One thorough account can be found in [2]. Another good accounting, and the one whose notation we adopt here, is [9].\nDeciding what category of connections we should work with is a subtle business. The correct formulation in N=1 theories from the physical standpoint is to examine constrained connections.\nDefinition 2. A superconnection A on a supermanifold with odd distribution τ is said to be constrained if the curvature F of A vanishes along τ. That is, if F⁢(x,y)=0 whenever x and y are odd vector fields.\nThere are physical reasons for requiring this, but from the mathematical perspective it’s just a subcategory we happen to be focusing on. Things are different in N=2 theories, though. Here there are eight odd directions to consider in four-dimensional theories. One proceeds by considering N=1 superconnections in six dimensions, where the spin bundle has eight dimensions. We will reduce this picture to four dimensions by requiring translation invariance along two dimensions, say the span of v and w for v,w∈ℝ6 linearly independent. So we examine a principal S⁢U⁢(2) bundle 𝒫 over E6|8 that is trivial in the v and w directions. Then we work with constrained connections that are constant along v and w.\nWe will see in a moment that such a dimensionally reduced object is no longer constrained. Instead, it can have two independent nonvanishing scalar curvatures on the odd distribution of E4|8.\nDefinition 3. A superconnection on a supermanifold whose curvature vanishes identically along the odd distribution except for two two-dimensional subdistributions along which the curvature is unconstrained is called semi-constrained.\nTheorem 1. The space of dimensionally reduced connections from E6|8 to E4|8 is isomorphic to the space of semi-constrained connections on E4|8.\nProof. It is easiest to use proper coordinates and vector fields from E6|8, so we give a brief run-down of this. Details can be found in [9]. ∎\nWe will use the name ya⁢b and θa⁢i for the coordinate system on E6|8, and ∂a⁢b and ∂a⁢i for the corresponding vector fields. Here, a,b take on the values 1 through 4, but with a\u0026lt;b. i can be 1 or 2. We denote the ε tensor in coordinates as εi⁢j (i and j can take on values 1 or 2).\nThe eight left-invariant vector fields are given by\n(15) Da⁢i=∂a⁢i-εi⁢j⁢θb⁢j⁢∂a⁢b and the right-invariant ones by\n(16) Qa⁢i=∂a⁢i+εi⁢j⁢θb⁢j⁢∂a⁢b with the commutation relations\n[Da⁢i,Db⁢j] = -εi⁢j⁢∂a⁢b [Qa⁢i,Qb⁢j] = +εi⁢j⁢∂a⁢b. By dimensional reduction we mean the restriction to E4|8, which is just the standard embedding of ℝ4 into ℝ6 by setting two coordinates on ℝ6 to zero. The effect on the coordinate systems we’ve been using is\ny12 =0 ⁢y23 =y2⁢1˙ (17) y13 =y1⁢1˙ ⁢y24 =y2⁢2˙ y14 =y1⁢2˙ ⁢y34 =0. We do not reduce the number of odd coordinates, though, and we can make a dictionary of left-invariant vector fields\nD11 =D1(1) ⁢D12 =D1(2) (18) D21 =D2(1) ⁢D22 =D2(2) D31 =-D¯1˙(2) ⁢D32 =D¯1˙(1) D41 =-D¯2˙(2) ⁢D42 =D¯.2˙(1) We are reducing by two dimensions, from E6|8 to E4|8, by setting the coordinates y12 and y34 to zero. Whereas we have on E6|8 the relation\n(19) [D31,D42]=-∂34, under the reduction correspondence (18), D31=-D¯1˙(2), D42=D¯,2˙(1) we instead have on E4|8 the equation\n(20) -[D¯,1˙(2)D¯]2˙(1)=0. The covariant version of (19) is\n(21) [𝒟31,𝒟42]=-∇34, and we can wonder, What happens to this equation after we dimensionally reduce? The two odd vector fields become two of the vector fields on E4|8, but ∂34 becomes zero, so what is the reduction of this covariant equation? The answer is that if the principal bundle 𝒫 and the connection are invariant under translations in the y34 direction, then there is a trivial lift of ∂34 which we will call ∂~34; it is the lift of ∂34 using the product connection in this trivial direction. The difference ∇34-∂~34 is a vertical vector field, or a section of the adjoint bundle. Dimensional reduction simply states that there can be no component of the lift of [D¯,1˙(2)D¯]2˙(1) in the ∂~34 direction, and so this bracket must lift to the vertical part of -∇34. We define\nΣ=∇34-∂~34 and thus have the dimensionally reduced equation\n(22) [𝒟¯1˙(2),𝒟¯2˙(1)]=Σ. This equation tells us that this particular component of odd-odd curvature need not vanish.\nSimilarly, we have\n[D41,D32]=∂34 so using the correspondence D41=-D¯2˙(2), D32=D¯1˙(1) we get\n(23) -[D¯,2˙(2)D¯]1˙(1)=Σ. Now, we consider constancy in the y12 direction. This leads to a second section of the adjoint bundle that we’ll call Σ¯\nΣ¯=∇12-∂~12. This in turn leads to the equations\n(24) -[𝒟2(2),𝒟1(1)] = Σ¯ (25) [𝒟1(2),𝒟2(1)] = Σ¯. This completes the proof.\nWe will see this theorem play out in the twisted context as well, where we will have two independent odd-odd curvatures that are not required to vanish.\n1.3.1. Component Fields The component fields of a superconnection in E4|8 are denoted A,σ,σ¯,λ,λ¯,χ,χ¯,E,F. These are\n(26) A=a connection on ⁢E4σ=a section of ⁢ad⁢Pσ¯=a section of ⁢ad⁢Pλ=a section of ⁢ad⁢P⊗(S+)*λ¯=a section of ⁢ad⁢P⊗(S-)*χ=a section of ⁢ad⁢P⊗(S+)*χ¯=a section of ⁢ad⁢P⊗(S-)*E=a section of ⁢ad⁢PF=a section of ⁢ad⁢P⊗ℂ These are defined as follows. A is the induced connection on the induced even bundle P→E4 sitting inside 𝒫→E4|8. The others are defined by\nσ =i*⁢Σ σ¯ =i*⁢Σ¯ λa =i*⁢Wa1=i*⁢14⁢εc˙⁢d˙⁢[𝒟¯c˙(1),∇a⁢d˙] χa =i*⁢Wa2=i*⁢14⁢εc˙⁢d˙⁢[𝒟¯c˙(2),∇a⁢d˙] (27) λ¯a˙ =i*⁢W¯a˙1=i*⁢14⁢εc⁢d⁢[𝒟c(1),∇d⁢a˙] χ¯a˙ =i*⁢W¯a˙2=i*⁢14⁢εc⁢d⁢[𝒟c(2),∇d⁢a˙] E =-i*⁢(𝒟¯2˙(1)⁢𝒟¯1˙(2)⁢Σ-𝒟¯1˙(1)⁢𝒟¯2˙(2)⁢Σ) F =i*⁢𝒟¯2˙(2)⁢𝒟¯1˙(2)⁢Σ F¯ =i*⁢𝒟¯1˙(1)⁢𝒟¯2˙(1)⁢Σ. Here, i* is the pullback functor using the inclusion i:E4↪E4|8.\nTheorem 2. The space of semi-constrained superconnections on E4|8 is isomorphic to the space of component fields.\nSee [9] for a discussion of this.\n1.4. The super Yang-Mills action Let τ be the complex parameter\n(28) τ=θ2⁢π+4⁢π⁢ig2. The action on super Minkowski space M4|8 is given by\n(29) S=∫d4⁢x⁢Im⁢(d4⁢θ⁢τ32⁢π⁢⟨Σ,Σ⟩) We will write this action in its component formulation. This is obtained from (29) by integrating out the four odd variables, or equivalently, hitting the integrand with an appropriate combination of four odd derivatives. In this case that is\n(30) D2(1)⁢D1(1)⁢D2(2)⁢D1(2), though other choices are appropriate as well, so long as they differ from this one by an exact term. See [9] for more information about this computation. The Dirac pairing seen below is defined by\n(31) ⟨λ⁢D/Aλ¯⟩=εa⁢c⁢εb˙⁢d˙⁢λc⁢∇a⁢b˙⁡λ¯d˙. The action in components is therefore given by\nS=∫d4x1g2{ - 12⁢|FA|2+⟨dA⁢σ¯,dA⁢σ⟩+⟨λ⁢D/Aλ¯⟩+⟨χ⁢D/Aχ¯⟩ - εa⁢b⟨σ¯,[λa,χb]⟩+εa˙⁢b˙⟨[λ¯,a˙χ¯]b˙,σ⟩-12|E|2 + ⟨F¯,F⟩}+θ16⁢π2⟨FA∧FA⟩. Note the presence of the usual Yang-Mills action (the first term), as well as the second Chern class (the last term). However, we are following the usual convention of having separate coupling coefficients for these two terms. This is because the topological Chern-Simons term has a different character in the physical theory, since it is locally constant on components of 𝒜. We will find reason to revisit the value of the coefficient of the “theta term” when we twist the action in Section 2.4.\nNext we write the result of Wick rotating this action to E4|8. This is a procedure we will not carry out explicitly, but merely write the result. For more information, see [3]. It differs only in the signs and some coefficients of i.\nS=∫d4x1g2{ - 12⁢|FA|2-i⁢⟨dA⁢σ¯,dA⁢σ⟩+i⁢⟨λ⁢D/Aλ¯⟩+i⁢⟨χ⁢D/Aχ¯⟩ + iεa⁢b⟨σ¯,[λa,χb]⟩+iεa˙⁢b˙⟨σ,[λ¯,a˙χ¯]b˙⟩-i12|E|2 + i⟨F¯,F⟩}+θ16⁢π2⟨FA∧FA⟩. The material in this section would greatly benefit from a treatment more within the philosophical scope of this paper. This remark applies equally to the computation of the twisted counterpart to the above action formula, which is a main result of the next section. The enterprising reader should perhaps focus on the operator (30), in search of a generalized interpretation and formula for an operator that integrates over the odd components of a superspace. 2. The superspace S⁢X 2.1. The twist The twisting operation is a modification of the global structure of E4|8. It will alter the structure of any theory over this base, and so we will obtain a class of theories that is very different from those on honest supersymmetric space. However, this trade-off allows us to construct an extension to any 4-manifold X that is analogous to extending E4 to E4|8.\nThe presence of the δ-function on the right hand side of the bracket relations (13) and (14) is a clue that there is an automorphism group of E4|8 that preserves the even subspace. We can see immediately that the group that acts on the Da(i) and D¯a˙(i) preserving the bracket is the group U⁢(2) preserving a symmetric hermitian bilinear pairing on ℂ2. One calls this U⁢(2) the R-symmetry group. We will only be discussing the subgroup S⁢U⁢(2)⊂U⁢(2). The quotient group U⁢(2)/S⁢U⁢(2)≅U⁢(1) plays quite a different role in the physics, and presumably in the mathematics as well, related to anomalies, but we will not encounter it further. We denote the S⁢U⁢(2) part of the R-symmetry by S⁢U⁢(2)R.\nThe odd fiber of E4|8 is a representation of 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4) as well as of S⁢U⁢(2)R. We denote the decomposition of 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4) as 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4)≅S⁢U⁢(2)+×S⁢U⁢(2)-. The R-symmetry allows us to construct an interesting and important map 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4) into H=S⁢U⁢(2)+×S⁢U⁢(2)-×S⁢U⁢(2)R. We define the twist homomorphism\nT:S⁢U⁢(2)+×S⁢U⁢(2)-→H by\n(34) T⁢(a,b)=(a,b,a) which is the diagonal embedding of S⁢U⁢(2) into S⁢U⁢(2)+×S⁢U⁢(2)R combined with the identity mapping of S⁢U⁢(2)-. Clearly H acts on ℂ2⊗ℂ2⊗ℂ2, so we can now form a new 𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑛⁢(4) associated vector bundle over E4 with fiber ℂ2⊗ℂ2⊗ℂ2 by precomposing with the mapping T. Another way to look at this operation is that we have declared that the index for the trivial ℂ2 fiber of E4|8 now labels another copy of S+ instead.\nWe can use this to do something very special. We can use the isomorphisms in Lemma 3 to prove immediately that these bundles factor through S⁢O⁢(4), and so can be formed on any riemannian 4-manifold. Since the twisted vector fields take values in (S+)*⊗S+ and (S-)*⊗S+, then after the twist one vector field takes values in ℝ, one of them takes values in ∧+2V, and one of them takes values in V. Explicitly we define\nD0 = D11+D22 D1 = (D¯2˙1-D¯1˙2)⁢d⁢v1+(-i⁢D¯2˙1-i⁢D¯1˙2)⁢d⁢v2 + (-D¯1˙1-D¯2˙2)⁢d⁢v3+(i⁢D¯1˙1-i⁢D¯2˙2)⁢d⁢v4 D2 = (i⁢D11+i⁢D22)⁢(d⁢v1∧d⁢v2+d⁢v3∧d⁢v4) + (D21-D12)⁢(d⁢v1∧d⁢v3-d⁢v2∧d⁢v4) + (-i⁢D21-i⁢D12)⁢(d⁢v1∧d⁢v4+d⁢v2∧d⁢v3). These three vector fields should have a more intrinsic description, one that does not make reference to supersymmetry or the spin bundles we have tensored together. The results along these lines are as follows.\nLet X be a riemannian four-manifold with local coordinate functions xi. Form the odd vector bundle\nSX=Π((X×ℂ)⊕TX⊕∧+2TX). The xi induce local bases ∂xi for vector fields, and d⁢xi for one-forms. We obtain induced coordinates in the Π⁢T⁢X directions that we will denote by θi (so θi is an odd coordinate function along the odd ∂xi direction). Similarly the xi induce coordinates in the ∧+2T⁢X directions. We will denote by θ1234 the coordinate in the odd ∂x1∧∂x2+∂x3∧∂x4 direction, θ1324 in the odd ∂x1∧∂x3-∂x2∧∂x4 direction, and θ1423 in the odd ∂x1∧∂x4+∂x2∧∂x3 direction. Lastly, we will call the coordinate in the trivial odd direction θ.\nDefine\nM = θ1234⊗(∂x1⊗d⁢x2-∂x2⊗d⁢x1+∂x3⊗d⁢x4-∂x4⊗d⁢x3) + θ1324⊗(∂x1⊗d⁢x3-∂x3⊗d⁢x1-∂x2⊗d⁢x4+∂x4⊗d⁢x2) + θ1423⊗(∂x1⊗d⁢x4-∂x4⊗d⁢x1+∂x2⊗d⁢x3-∂x3⊗d⁢x2). We can now state intrinsic (although coordinate-dependent) formulas for the Di.\nProposition 1. D0=∂θ-θi⁢∂xi, D1=∂θi⁡d⁢xi-θ⁢∂xi⁡d⁢xi-M and\nD2 =∂θ1234⁡(d⁢x1∧d⁢x2+d⁢x3∧d⁢x4) +∂θ1324⁡(d⁢x1∧d⁢x3-d⁢x2∧d⁢x4) +∂θ1423⁡(d⁢x1∧d⁢x4+d⁢x2∧d⁢x3) -(θ1⁢∂x2-θ2⁢∂x1+θ3⁢∂x4-θ4⁢∂x3)⁢(d⁢x1∧d⁢x2+d⁢x3∧d⁢x4) -(θ1⁢∂x3-θ3⁢∂x1-θ2⁢∂x4+θ4⁢∂x2)⁢(d⁢x1∧d⁢x3-d⁢x2∧d⁢x4) -(θ1⁢∂x4-θ4⁢∂x1+θ2⁢∂x3-θ3⁢∂x2)⁢(d⁢x1∧d⁢x4+d⁢x2∧d⁢x3) Proof. First a bit of motivation. The vector fields Dba and D¯b˙a are made of two terms: a partial derivative in an odd direction and an odd coordinate function times an even partial derivative. Let us try to construct global objects with this form. Guessing at the formula for D0, for example, is easy if you want to obtain this form. The others are more complex.\nTo construct the 1-form D1, we can take advantage of the redundancy in having X and Π⁢T⁢X both available, and use the isomorphism between the odd and even tangent spaces. This is what ∂θi⁡d⁢xi does. We can also construct de Rham d, the identity element in H⁢o⁢m⁢(T⁢X,T⁢X), and multiply it by θ. Lastly for D1 we can try to find an element of\nΠ∧+2T⁢X⊗T⁢X⊗T*⁢X where the first factor are the θa⁢b⁢c⁢d coefficients, the second are the vector fields, and the third are the d⁢xi. Is there a canonical element of this bundle? Yes, look at\nId∈Π∧+2TX⊗∧+2T*X and map it through the inclusion Π∧+2TX⊗∧+2T*X↪Π∧+2TX⊗T*X⊗T*X followed by taking the dual on the first T*⁢X using the metric. This is the element M.\nFor D2 we can use the isomorphism between the even and the odd self-dual 2-vectors, which is what the first three terms of D2 do. For the second set of three terms we take the element\nId∈∧+2TX⊗∧+2T*X and map it through the inclusion\n∧+2TX⊗∧+2T*X↪TX⊗TX⊗∧+2T*X followed by taking parity reversal on the first T⁢X. Although these three constructions are very canonical and unique, they do not suffice to prove the relationship to the E4|8 formulas. However, once we have proven this relationship rigorously, we should leave the Proposition with the sense that twisted supersymmetry has a very rich and deep relationship to intrinsic smooth objects.\nWe will prove the formula for D0 as an example, and leave the rest as exercises. θ is the coordinate in the trivial line bundle direction, and we have from (8) that θ=θ11+θ22. To write out θi⁢∂i we use (6) directly on the partials, and use (6) plus the usual change of variables formula for the θa⁢b˙’s. The change of variables has the effect of taking the complex conjugate compared to the ∂ formulas, which is analogous to the relationship z=x+i⁢y,∂z=∂x-i⁢∂y.\nθ1⁢∂1 =(θ1⁢1˙+θ2⁢2˙)⁢(∂1⁢1˙+∂2⁢2˙) θ2⁢∂2 =(-i⁢θ1⁢1˙+i⁢θ2⁢2˙)⁢(i⁢∂1⁢1˙-i⁢∂2⁢2˙) θ3⁢∂3 =(θ1⁢2˙-θ2⁢1˙)⁢(∂1⁢2˙-∂2⁢1˙) θ4⁢∂4 =(-i⁢θ1⁢2˙-i⁢θ2⁢1˙)⁢(i⁢∂1⁢2˙+i⁢∂2⁢1˙). Adding this all up gives\n∂11+θ1⁢1˙⁢∂1⁢1˙+θ1⁢2˙⁢∂1⁢2˙+∂22+θ2⁢1˙⁢∂2⁢1˙+θ2⁢2˙⁢∂2⁢2˙=Q11+Q22, as required. ∎\nWe also define Q analogues of D0, D1 and D2, but with plus signs instead of minus signs. Explicitly we have Q0=∂θ+θi⁢∂xi, Q1=∂θi⁡d⁢xi+θ⁢∂xi⁡d⁢xi+M and\nQ2 =∂θ1234⁡(d⁢x1∧d⁢x2+d⁢x3∧d⁢x4) +∂θ1324⁡(d⁢x1∧d⁢x3-d⁢x2∧d⁢x4) +∂θ1423⁡(d⁢x1∧d⁢x4+d⁢x2∧d⁢x3) +(θ1⁢∂x2-θ2⁢∂x1+θ3⁢∂x4-θ4⁢∂x3)⁢(d⁢x1∧d⁢x2+d⁢x3∧d⁢x4) +(θ1⁢∂x3-θ3⁢∂x1-θ2⁢∂x4+θ4⁢∂x2)⁢(d⁢x1∧d⁢x3-d⁢x2∧d⁢x4) +(θ1⁢∂x4-θ4⁢∂x1+θ2⁢∂x3-θ3⁢∂x2)⁢(d⁢x1∧d⁢x4+d⁢x2∧d⁢x3). Using these formulas, it is trivial to check that all three Q’s commute with all three D’s. Also, other commutators that will interest us are\n(38) [D0,D1] =-d (39) =d. Here, and from now on, we will use the following definition of the bracket\n(40) [A,B]=12⁢(A⁢B-(-1)π⁢(A)⁢π⁢(B)⁢B⁢A). 2.2. Superconnections on S⁢X The general idea is that we will simply twist the picture presented in (26). For example, the two S+-valued sections λ and χ of ad⁢P will combine to form a single (S+)*⊗S+-valued section of ad⁢P, and so will decompose as a section of ad⁢P and a section of adP⊗∧+2TX.\nLet us begin with the spinors λ and χ. In flat space they are defined by\n(41) χa=i*⁢Wa1=i*⁢14⁢εc˙⁢d˙⁢[𝒟¯c˙(1),∇a⁢d˙] (42) λa=i*⁢Wa2=i*⁢14⁢εc˙⁢d˙⁢[𝒟¯c˙(2),∇a⁢d˙]. These can therefore equivalently be defined as the image of the expression\n14⁢[𝒟¯c˙(i),∇a⁢d˙] under the mapping\n(ε-)*:(S-)*⊗S+⊗(S-)*⊗(S+)*→S+⊗(S+)*. A computation shows that this operation can be interpreted quite simply in global language. Precisely, we have\nProposition 2. The following diagram commutes\n(43) (S-)*⊗S+⊗(S-)*⊗(S+)*→(ε-)*S+⊗(S+)*↓≅↓≅T⁢X⊗T⁢X→proj.(X×ℝ)⊕∧+2TX The barred spinors λ¯ and χ¯ are defined by\n(44) λ¯a˙=i*⁢W¯a˙1=i*⁢14⁢εc⁢d⁢[𝒟c(1),∇d⁢a˙] (45) χ¯a˙=i*⁢W¯a˙2=i*⁢14⁢εc⁢d⁢[𝒟c(2),∇d⁢a˙]. These are the images of the expressions\n14⁢[𝒟c(i),∇d⁢a˙] under the mapping ε+:(S+)*⊗S+⊗(S+)*⊗(S-)*→S+⊗(S-)*. Here, we obtain another diagram that tells us how to interpret this mapping in global language.\nProposition 3. The following diagram commutes.\n(46) (S+)*⊗S+⊗(S+)*⊗(S-)*→ε+S+⊗(S-)*↓≅↓≅((X×ℝ)⊕∧+2TX)⊗TX→CT⁢X where the mapping C is given on a fiber by\n(47) C⁢((a,ω)⊗v)=a⁢v+iv*⁢ω. Proof. To prove Proposition 2 we need to show that the bottom arrow in (43) is indeed given by the obvious projection. We use (6) and (9) to compute\nv1⊗v2 =(e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙)⊗(i⁢e1⁢1˙-i⁢e2⁢2˙) ↦ε+-i⁢e12-i⁢e21 =v1∧v2+v3∧v4 v1⊗v3 =(e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙)⊗(e1⁢2˙-e2⁢1˙) ↦ε+e11+e22 =v1∧v3-v2∧v4 v1⊗v4 =(e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙)⊗(i⁢e2⁢1˙+i⁢e2⁢1˙) ↦ε+i⁢e11-i⁢e22 =v1∧v4+v2∧v3 with similar formulas for v2⊗v1 etc. We also get\nv1⊗v1 =(e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙)⊗(e1⁢1˙+e2⁢2˙) ↦ε+e12-e21 =1∈ℝ with identical formulas for vi⊗vi, i=2,3,4. This completes the proof of Proposition 2. Proposition 3 is proved with a similar computation. ∎\nThe X×ℝ component of the space on the bottom of (43) is just the trivial bundle spanned by the identity section of T*⁢X⊗T⁢X, followed by using the metric to map T*⁢X→T⁢X. So, what we have learned is that the unbarred spinors λ,χ, in twisted language, can be built as follows. The image of the 𝒟¯c˙(i) under the vertical map in the diagram is simply the horizontal lift of D1, which we’ll denote by 𝒟1. The image of the ∇d⁢a˙ is just the horizontal lift of de Rham d, which we usually denote by ∇. Let us decompose the projection on the bottom of the diagram with the maps\n(48) ε0:T⁢X⊗T⁢X→X×ℝ (49) ε2:T⁢X⊗T⁢X→∧+2T⁢X. Then if we define\n(50) W0=ε0⁢[𝒟1,∇] (51) W2=ε2⁢[𝒟1,∇] (52) ψ0=i*⁢W0 (53) ψ2=i*⁢W2 we have met two goals. We have defined two component fields in global language on S⁢X, but we have also proved with Proposition 2 that these two components can be rewritten in local coordinates as the λ and χ we saw before.\nWe see from (46) that the restriction of C to the subspace (X×ℝ)⊗T⁢X≅T⁢X has the same image as all of C. So, we can build the barred spinors in a global way by forming the bracket [𝒟0,∇].\n(54) W1=-12⁢[𝒟0,∇] (55) ψ1=i*⁢W1. Next define\nΦ=-[𝒟0,𝒟0] Φ¯=-14⁢ε0⁢[𝒟1,𝒟1] and ϕ=i*⁢Φ ϕ¯=i*⁢Φ¯. Proposition 4. ϕ is the twisted version of σ¯ and ϕ¯ is the twisted version of σ.\nProof. We compute that\nΦ =-[𝒟0,𝒟0] =-[𝒟11+𝒟22,𝒟11+𝒟22] =-2⁢[𝒟11,𝒟22], which agrees with (24). Similarly,\n-4⁢Φ¯ =-14⁢ε0⁢[𝒟1,𝒟1] =[𝒟¯1˙(2)-𝒟¯2˙(1),𝒟¯1˙(2)-𝒟¯2˙(1)]+[i⁢𝒟¯1˙(2)+i⁢𝒟¯2˙(1),i⁢𝒟¯1˙(2)+i⁢𝒟¯2˙(1)] +[𝒟¯2˙(2)+𝒟¯1˙(1),𝒟¯2˙(2)+𝒟¯1˙(1)]+[i⁢𝒟¯2˙(2)-i⁢𝒟¯1˙(1),i⁢𝒟¯2˙(2)-i⁢𝒟¯1˙(1)] =4⁢[𝒟¯2˙(2),𝒟¯1˙(1)]-4⁢[𝒟¯1˙(2),𝒟¯2˙(1)], which is the sum of (22) and (23), completing the proof. However, if we compute\n-[𝒟2,𝒟2] =[-i⁢𝒟11+i⁢𝒟22,-i⁢𝒟11+i⁢𝒟22]+[𝒟21-𝒟12,𝒟21-𝒟12] +[-i⁢𝒟21-i⁢𝒟12,-i⁢𝒟21-i⁢𝒟12] =-2⁢[𝒟11,𝒟22]+4⁢[𝒟21,𝒟12] then we see that it is also very natural to form the object\n-[𝒟0,𝒟0]-[𝒟2,𝒟2], which agrees with the sum of (24) and (25). However, we do not adopt this alternate definition of Φ. ∎\nWe now proceed to discuss the fact that in flat space there are three auxiliary fields. The natural guess is to find some self-dual two-vector field that can be written using the twist as these three fields. If we name this single twisted auxiliary field by the name E2 then we claim Proposition 5. E2=i*⁢12⁢ε2⁢(𝒟1⁢[𝒟0,∇]) is the twisted version of the auxiliary fields E and F.\nProof. We rewrite E2 as\nE2 =i*⁢12⁢ε2⁢(𝒟1⁢([𝒟0,∇])) =-i*⁢ε2⁢(𝒟1⁢W1) =-i*⁢ε2⁢(𝒟1⁢𝒟1⁢Φ) and then consider what ε2 does to 𝒟1⁢𝒟1. If we label the four components of 𝒟1 in a coordinate chart by 𝒟1i then we can compute that\n𝒟11⁢𝒟12+𝒟13⁢𝒟14 =(𝒟¯1˙1+𝒟¯2˙2)⁢(𝒟¯2˙1-𝒟¯1˙2)-(i⁢𝒟¯1˙1-i⁢𝒟¯2˙2)⁢(i⁢𝒟¯2˙1+i⁢𝒟¯1˙2) =𝒟¯1˙1⁢𝒟¯2˙1-𝒟¯2˙2⁢𝒟¯1˙2 and so checking with (27) we see that one of the three components of ε2⁢𝒟1⁢𝒟1⁢Φ is F¯-F. Similar computations reveal that the second component, D11⁢D13-D12⁢D14, is F+F¯ and the third, D11⁢D14+D12⁢D13, gives E, which completes the proof. ∎\nIn summary we have proved the following key result.\nTheorem 3. Let P be a principal S⁢U⁢(2) bundle over the supermanifold S⁢X. Let P→X be the restriction of P to X. The space of semi-constrained superconnections on P is isomorphic to the space of fields A,ϕ,ϕ¯,ψ0,ψ1,ψ2,E2, where A is an ordinary connection on the restriction P→X of P→S⁢X, ϕ and ϕ¯ are sections of ad⁢P, ψ0∈Γ(Π(X×R)⊗adP)), ψ1∈Γ⁢(Π⁢T⁢X⊗ad⁢P), ψ2∈Γ⁢(Π∧+2T⁢X⊗ad⁢P), and E2∈Γ⁢(∧+2T⁢X⊗ad⁢P).\nProof. It suffices to work in a coordinate patch, where by the preceding discussion the theorem reduces to its N=2 flat space counterpart Theorem 1. ∎\n2.3. The action of Q0 We will now go about computing the vector field on S⁢𝒜 that is induced by Q0. What we mean is that the vector field Q0 on S⁢X acts on functions and bundle sections by covariant differentiation, and so it acts on the points of the space S⁢𝒜. The infinitesimal form of this action is again a vector field and we are going to try to express it in terms of components. Let η be an odd parameter. If 𝒜 is a semi-constrained superconnection then denote by ξ the diffeomorphism generated by the even vector field η⁢𝒬0. To get formulas in components, then, we are searching for the components of ξ⁢𝒜. These components are defined using the 𝒟i, which all commute with ξ. Moreover, when restricted to the even submanifold P⊂𝒫 the vector fields 𝒟0 and 𝒬0 agree with each other. This all implies that we can compute the action of 𝒬0 by using 𝒟0 instead. And so, our approach will simply be to hit the component fields with 𝒟0 on the left and rewrite them in terms of each other after some dust settles. A key tool will be the super Bianchi identity, which is the Bianchi identity with parity taken into account.\nTheorem 4 (Bianchi). Let F be the curvature of a connection A on a principal bundle P→S⁢X. Let X,Y,Z be vector fields on S⁢X. Let X^,Y^,Z^ denote the horizontal lifts to P. If π⁢(X) denotes the parity of the vector field X then\n0=(X^⁢ℱ)⁢(Y,Z) +(-1)π⁢(X)⁢π⁢(Y)+π⁢(X)⁢π⁢(Z)⁢(Y^⁢ℱ)⁢(Z,X) +(-1)π⁢(Z)⁢π⁢(X)+π⁢(Z)⁢π⁢(Y)⁢(Z^⁢ℱ)⁢(X,Y), where the covariant derivative of a two-form is given by the super formula\n(X^⁢ℱ)⁢(Y,Z)=X^⁢(ℱ⁢(Y,Z))-ℱ⁢([X,Y],Z)+(-1)π⁢(X)⁢π⁢(Y)⁢ℱ⁢(Y,[X,Z]). We apply this theorem as follows. The identity on the three vector fields D0, D0 and d yields\n𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D0,d))-ℱ⁢([D0,D0],d)+ℱ⁢(D0,[D0,d])-𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(d,D0))+ℱ⁢([D0,d],D0)+ℱ⁢(d,[D0,D0])+∇⁡(ℱ⁢(D0,D0))-ℱ⁢([d,D0],D0)-ℱ⁢(D0,[d,D0])=0. In this expression, the second and sixth terms vanish due to D02=0 and the third, fifth, eighth and ninth vanish due to the fact that the connection is semi-constrained. This leaves us with 𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D0,d))-𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(d,D0))+∇⁡(ℱ⁢(D0,D0))=0, which gives on restriction to X\n(56) 𝒟0ψ1=-∇ϕ. Next we examine the identity for three copies of D0.\n𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D0,D0))-ℱ⁢([D0,D0],D0)+ℱ⁢(D0,[D0,D0])+𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D0,D0))-ℱ⁢([D0,D0],D0)+ℱ⁢(D0,[D0,D0])+𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D0,D0))-ℱ⁢([D0,D0],D0)+ℱ⁢(D0,[D0,D0])=0 which immediately becomes\n(57) 𝒟0ϕ=0. Next we work with D0, D1 and d to obtain\n𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D1,d))-ℱ⁢([D0,D1],d)+ℱ⁢(D1,[D0,d])-𝒟1⁢(ℱ⁢(d,D0))+ℱ⁢([D1,d],D0)+ℱ⁢(d,[D1,D0])+∇⁡(ℱ⁢(D0,D1))-ℱ⁢([d,D0],D1)-ℱ⁢(D0,[d,D1])=0 whose third, fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth terms vanish because the connection is semi-constrained. Using the fact that\n[D1,D0]=[D0,D1]=d gives\n𝒟0((ℱ(D1,d))-𝒟1(ℱ(d,D0))=0. This yields the equation\n𝒟0⁢ψ2 =i*⁢ε2⁢(𝒟1⁢(ℱ⁢(d,D0))) (58) =E2. so we have\n(59) 𝒟0ψ2=E2. Next we compute with D0, D1 and D1.\n𝒟0⁢(ℱ⁢(D1,D1))-ℱ⁢([D0,D1],D1)+ℱ⁢(D1,[D0,D1])+𝒟1⁢(ℱ⁢(D1,D0))-ℱ⁢([D1,D1],D0)+ℱ⁢(D1,[D1,D0])+𝒟1⁢(ℱ⁢(D0,D1))-ℱ⁢([D1,D0],D1)+ℱ⁢(D0,[D1,D1])=0. the fourth and seventh terms vanish by the semi-constrained condition. We are going to use this equation to compute 𝒟0⁢ϕ¯ and so we need to take ε0 of both sides. ε0 takes the trace of this bracket, and because individual components of 𝒟1 square to zero we kill the terms with [𝒟1,𝒟1]. This leaves us with\n(60) 𝒟0ϕ¯=ψ0. Next let’s work out 𝒟0⁢A. To compute a component of this one-form we’d examine the restriction to X of\ni⁢(∇xμ)⁢L⁢(𝒟0)⁢A. To get the global version of this, we simply replace the partial with ∇. (61) i⁢(∇)⁢L⁢(𝒟0)⁢A =L⁢(-𝒟0)⁢i⁢(∇)⁢A-i⁢(2⁢[𝒟0,∇])⁢A (62) =0-2⁢[𝒟0,∇] (63) =W1 so that we obtain\n(64) 𝒟0A=ψ1. This leaves us with the computations for ψ0 and E2. These are in the image of 𝒟0 though, and we can argue as follows. If f is some component field, we can compute\n(65) i*⁢𝒟0⁢𝒟0⁢f =i*⁢[𝒟0,𝒟0]⁢f (66) =i*⁢∇F⁢(D0,D0)⁡f (67) =∇-ϕ⁡f (68) =-[ϕ,f]. Using this we obtain (69) ⁢𝒟0⁢ψ0=-[ϕ,ϕ¯] (70) ⁢𝒟0⁢(FA+-E2)=-[ϕ,ψ2]. The total result is then\n(71) 𝒬0⁢(Aψ1ϕϕ¯ψ0ψ2E2)=(ψ1-∇⁡ϕ0ψ0-[ϕ,ϕ¯]E2-[ϕ,ψ2])(A,ψ1,ϕ,ϕ¯,ψ0,ψ2,E2) This is a vector field on S⁢𝒜, and so can be used as a differential operator on functions on S⁢𝒜. We have decomposed the infinite dimensional space S⁢𝒜 into seven subspaces,\n(72) S⁢𝒜=𝒜×Π⁢Ω1×Ω0×Ω0×Π⁢Ω0×Π⁢Ω+2×Ω+2 (where we omit the (X;ad⁢P)’s from the notation for clarity). Suppose f is a function on S⁢𝒜, and we would like to compute the derivative of f using 𝒬0, i.e. 𝒬0⁢f. Suppose further that we have an explicit expression for f as a combination of various component fields. In order to compute a similarly explicit expression for 𝒬0⁢f, we use the Leibnitz rule and the chain rule, and then ask the question “what is 𝒬0 evaluated on an individual component field?” One computes this derivative by taking the corresponding component of 𝒬0.\nAn analogous situation is the following. Suppose we work on a finite-dimensional manifold X and use local coordinates xμ,μ=1,…,n to express a computation. Let f⁢(x1,…,xn)=xi for some fixed i in these coordinates. If V=∑kak⁢(x1,…,xn)⁢∂∂⁡xk is a vector field in this patch, then V⁢f⁢(x1,…,xn)= ai⁢(x1,…,xn), the ith component of V.\n2.4. The action after the twist We will twist the formula (1.4). Many of the terms there do not respond to the twist, which affects only the fermions and auxiliary fields as we have seen. However, note that in our notation σ is ϕ¯ and σ¯ is ϕ. With just this we find that the twisted action has the terms\n1g2{-|FA|2+-i⟨ϕ¯,dA*dAϕ⟩-i|E2|2}+θ16⁢π2⟨FA,FA⟩. It remains to twist the fermionic terms. First we examine\n⟨λ⁢D/Aλ¯⟩+⟨χ⁢D/Aχ¯⟩. Lemma 4. In local coordinates on S⁢X we have\n(73) ⟨λ⁢D/Aλ¯⟩+⟨χ⁢D/Aχ¯⟩=⟨ψ0,dA*⁢ψ1⟩+⟨ψ2,dA+⁢ψ1⟩ Proof. We express the right hand side in spinorial coordinates to prove the lemma. By way of motivation, examine (31). The element being hit with the two epsilon tensors is an element of\n(S+)*⊗S+⊗(S+)*⊗(S-)*⊗(S-)*⊗S+ and the ε’s are contracting the two (S+)* spaces and the two (S-)* spaces. We formed a picture of these two contractions in Propositions 2 and 3. For instance, the ε- contraction on the (S-)* spaces will combine the ∇a⁢b˙⁡λb˙ (and its twin ∇a⁢b˙⁡χb˙ which is not separate in this context) by mapping to (X×ℝ)⊕∧+2TX. Clearly this will produce dA*⁢ψ1 and dA+⁢ψ1. Recalling (6), (7) and (8) we compute\n2⁢dA+⁢ψ1=((∂1⁢1˙+∂2⁢2˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯1˙-i⁢λ¯2˙)-(i⁢∂1⁢1˙-i⁢∂2⁢2˙)⁢(-χ¯1˙+λ¯2˙)(∂1⁢1˙+∂2⁢2˙)⁢(-χ¯2˙-λ¯1˙)-(∂1⁢2˙-∂2⁢1˙)⁢(-χ¯1˙+λ¯2˙)(∂1⁢1˙+∂2⁢2˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯2˙+i⁢λ¯1˙)-(i⁢∂1⁢2˙+i⁢∂2⁢1˙)⁢(-χ¯1˙+λ¯2˙)+(∂1⁢2˙-∂2⁢1˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯2˙+i⁢λ¯1˙)-(i⁢∂1⁢2˙+i⁢∂2⁢1˙)⁢(-χ¯2˙-λ¯1˙)-(i⁢∂1⁢1˙-i⁢∂2⁢2˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯2˙+i⁢λ¯1˙)+(i⁢∂1⁢2˙+i⁢∂2⁢1˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯1˙-i⁢λ¯2˙)+(i⁢∂1⁢1˙-i⁢∂2⁢2˙)⁢(-χ¯2˙-λ¯1˙)-(∂1⁢2˙-∂2⁢1˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯1˙-i⁢λ¯2˙)) To express ψ2 in spinor coordinates, we use (8) together with the fact that elements with upper index 1 are called χ and with upper index 2 are called λ (see (44) and (45)). We get\n4⁢ψ2=(-i⁢χ1+i⁢λ2χ2-λ1-i⁢χ2-i⁢λ1). Similarly,\n4⁢ψ0=χ1+λ2 and\n2⁢dA*⁢ψ1=(∇1⁢1˙+∇2⁢2˙)⁢(-χ¯1˙+λ¯2˙)+(i⁢∇1⁢1˙-i⁢∇2⁢2˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯1˙-i⁢λ¯2˙)+(∇1⁢2˙-∇2⁢1˙)⁢(-χ¯2˙-λ¯1˙)+(i⁢∇1⁢2˙+i⁢∇2⁢1˙)⁢(-i⁢χ¯2˙+i⁢λ¯1˙) Computing ⟨ψ0,dA*⁢ψ1⟩+⟨ψ2,dA+⁢ψ1⟩ is now a matter of combining these expressions and cancelling half of the terms, leaving us with the desired quantity. ∎\nNext we work with the terms involving brackets of spinors. Something surprising will result — a term that will not play a role in the geometrical picture that emerges in the next section.\nLemma 5. In local coordinates on S⁢X we have\n(74) εa⁢b⁢[λa,χb] =14⁢[ψ2,ψ2]+14⁢[ψ0,ψ0] (75) εa˙⁢b˙⁢[λ¯a˙,χ¯b˙] =ε0⁢[ψ1,ψ1]. Proof. We compute ε0⁢[ψ1,ψ1]= -14([-χ¯1˙+λ¯2˙,-χ¯1˙+λ¯2˙]+[-iχ¯1˙-iλ¯2˙,-iχ¯1˙-iλ¯2˙] +[-χ¯2˙-λ¯1˙,-χ¯2˙-λ¯1˙]+[-iχ¯2˙+iλ¯1˙,-iχ¯2˙+iλ¯1˙]) = [λ¯1˙,χ¯2˙]-[λ¯2˙,χ¯1˙]. And using the fact that the bracket uses the structure of the wedge product on forms, and that the components of ψ2 wedge to zero except against themselves, we obtain\n14⁢[ψ2,ψ2]+14⁢[ψ0,ψ0]= 14([-iλ1+iχ2,-iλ1+iχ2]+[λ2-χ1,λ2-χ1] +[-iλ2-iχ1,-iλ2-iχ1]+[λ1+χ2,λ1+χ2]) = [λ1,χ2]-[λ2,χ1]. This completes the proof. ∎\nThus we have computed\n∫S⁢𝒜exp(1g2( -12⁢|FA|2-i⁢⟨ϕ¯,dA*⁢dA⁢ϕ⟩+i⁢⟨ψ0,dA*⁢ψ1⟩+i⁢⟨ψ2,(dA⁢ψ1)+⟩ (76) +i⟨ψ2,[ϕ,ψ2]⟩+i⟨ϕ,[ψ0,ψ0]⟩+i⟨ϕ¯,[ψ1,*ψ1]⟩ (77) -i|E2|2)+θ16⁢π2⟨FA∧FA⟩) If we tweak the parameter θ, we can obtain the sum\n-12⁢g2⁢|FA|2-12⁢g2⁢⟨FA∧FA⟩ which becomes\n-1g2⁢|FA+|2 This particular value for θ will be fixed from now on, for it facilitates the geometric interpretation we will dwell on presently. Note that with this alteration the whole action has an overall coefficient of 1g2. This is the coupling parameter for this physical theory, and when written outside the action it acts like Planck’s constant h. Namely, we can see directly (if path integration makes sense) that if the coupling becomes vanishingly small then the minima of S are heavily weighed in a path integral computation, and we approach a classical limit. We will prefer a different interpretation for the coupling parameter and so we scale some of the fields as follows\nϕ ↦g2⁢ϕ ψ0 ↦g2⁢ψ0 ψ2 ↦g2⁢ψ2 E2 ↦g⁢E2, producing the formula we will use going forward:\n(78) ∫S⁢𝒜exp( -1g2⁢|FA+|2-i⁢⟨ϕ¯,dA*⁢dA⁢ϕ⟩+i⁢⟨ψ0,dA*⁢ψ1⟩+i⁢⟨ψ2,(dA⁢ψ1)+⟩ (79) +g2i⟨ψ2,[ϕ,ψ2]⟩+g2i⟨ϕ,[ψ0,ψ0]⟩+i⟨ϕ¯,[ψ1,*ψ1]⟩-i|E2|2) We make one final remark about this computation. It should in principle be possible to compute the twisted action directly on S⁢X, perhaps using a multiple of\n∫Π⁢T⁢XTr⁢Φ2-∫Π((X×ℝ)⊕∧2+TX)Tr⁢Φ¯2. which corresponds to (29). To compute this in components, one would hit each integrand with an appropriate differential operator. For example, the first odd integral could be carried out by hitting Tr⁢Φ2 with (D1)4, interpreted in an appropriate sense. Similarly, the second integral could be carried out with the help of D0∘(D2)3 where the cube is perhaps interpreted to mean the determinant on the third tensor power of the 3-dimensional bundle ∧2+T⁢X. This computation should be straightforward once the meaning of these operators is sorted out. Some insight into S⁢X is sure to be gained by this exercise.\n3. The polynomial invariants The definitions of the component fields of semi-constrained superconnections give a decomposition of S⁢𝒜. A central result of this paper is that this decomposition can be viewed as a rich algebraic structure living on the usual space of connections. Without having ever mentioned the ASD equations or the action of the group of gauge transformations, we will find that in a formal sense these are automatically called for by the structure of S⁢𝒜.\nLet P be a principal G-bundle over a base X and let V be a 2⁢n-dimensional representation of G. Form the associated vector bundle E=P×GV. On this vector bundle there is a Thom class 𝒯∈Hc2⁢n⁢(E) in compactly supported cohomology. It has maximal degree along the fibers, and so is fully “vertical.” One can pull back a representative of 𝒯 to X by the zero section s and obtain a representative e of the Euler class of E. If one pulls 𝒯 back by a nonzero section s, one can interpret the pullback s*⁢(𝒯) as the Poincaré dual to the zero set Zs of s. And so, to integrate a differential form ω over Zs one can integrate ω∧s*⁢(𝒯) over all of X.\nMathai and Quillen [10] introduced a representative 𝒯A for the Thom class that lives in the G-equivariant cohomology of P×V. The A denotes a connection on P, which is used in the construction. In fact, they write an element of the Cartan algebra of V, which is an algebraic model of equivariant cohomology, and then use the connection to map it to an equivariant differential form on P×V, using the Weil homomorphism. Mathai and Quillen showed that if s is an arbitrary section of E, then s*⁢𝒯A=es,A is a representative for the Euler class, and is independent of both A and s. To be totally explicit, they write\n(80) es,A=1(2⁢π)n⁢∫𝑑ψ⁢e-∥s∥2+12⁢⟨ψ,ϕ⁢ψ⟩+i⁢⟨d⁢s,ψ⟩ where ψ is an element of Π⁢V. The object ϕ is an element of the equivariant cohomology, and under the Weil homomorphism it maps to FA, which we will discuss a little later. Note that this element has rapid decrease along the fiber V, but is not compactly supported. In fact, the inclusion of compactly supported forms into forms with rapid decrease induces an isomorphism of cohomology.\nTaking s=0 produces Pfaff⁢(FA), which restates the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Taking s nonzero and multiplying by a constant γ to get γ⁢s and then taking γ→∞ localizes es,A to the zero set of s. This can be proven by approximating (80) with the method of steepest descent. Also relevant for us is a modification of this picture that lets us work upstairs. Let s be a section of E, and suppose we want to compute\n∫Zsω for some form ω. We know we can instead work with\n∫Xω∧es,A. However, we can further enlarge the space we integrate over to E if we can find an appropriate differential form that has maximal degree along the fibers of P and that integrates to 1 on a fiber. Such a form is called a projection form, and if we call it ηproj then we have\n∫Zsω=∫Eω∧es,A∧ηproj. It is familiar in Donaldson theory that the ASD moduli space can be defined as the zero set of the section FA+:𝒜/𝒢→Ω+2⁢(X;ad⁢P). If there were such an object as a Thom class in this infinite-dimensional context, we could hope that the pullback by FA+ would be in some sense Poincaré dual to the ASD moduli space. Surely such a geometrical construction could be carried out mathematically, but it has not yet been done. The problem is that the space ℬ of connections modulo gauge transformations is infinite-dimensional and the fiber of the vector bundle, Ω+2⁢(X;ad⁢P) is also infinite-dimensional. In addition, the group 𝒢 has infinite dimension, so the concept of the projection form as a “top-dimensional” form along the fibers of 𝒜→ℬ does not make sense. Nonetheless, if we ignore these issues we will see that a straightforward application of the above construction to FA+ produces the twisted action (78).\nSo the simple twisting operation has brought us from a physical supersymmetric theory all the way to the ASD moduli space, equipped with an Euler class to help us do intersection theory. All that is missing is Donaldson’s μ-map, which has a beautiful manifestation in this context, as we will see below.\nMuch of this treatment of the Mathai-Quillen form and the projection form is based on [6]. The original insight into the geometry underlying the action is in Atiyah and Jeffrey’s paper [1]. The following account differs from Atiyah and Jeffrey’s, however, in two important respects. First of all, we build the geometrical constructions from the structure of S⁢𝒜 itself, using the operator 𝒬0 and the component fields to prove that the equivariant cohomological data we need is encoded in the twisted supersymmetry. This is a very important observation, as it uses the twist to show that the Mathai-Quillen and projection forms naturally arise from supersymmetry, and so motivate doing Donaldson theory rather than just imitating Donaldson theory. Thinking of Donaldson theory as an outgrowth of twisted supersymmetry may eventually prove to be useful for gaining additional insights about smooth structures on 4-manifolds. The second departure from Atiyah and Jeffrey’s work is that we will try to de-emphasize the interpretation of the path integral as a representation of a nonexistent Euler class. Instead, we will discuss the physical approach to path integration and show how the localization to the ASD moduli space is obtained by examining the classical limit of the quantum theory. Strengthening the link with physics fits into our overarching strategy of initiating an investigation into Witten’s Conjecture, but the reader should be clear on one point: understanding what an Euler class is in infinite dimensions will shed light on both the Donaldson invariants and on path integrals, and so we are not advocating that mathematicians should neglect to sort those ideas out.\n3.1. The algebraic structure of S⁢𝒜 We define two subspaces of S⁢𝒜.\n(81) L⁢(𝒜) =Ω0×Ω+2×Π⁢Ω+2 (82) P⁢(𝒜) =𝒜×Π⁢Ω1×Ω0×Ω0×Π⁢Ω0 where the shared copy of Ω0 is the one given by elements we have been calling ϕ. (Sometimes we will want to use dual spaces of a few of these pieces but we will feel free to switch to the dual spaces as needed.) Keeping this structure in mind, we will digress temporarily to treat more carefully the two finite-dimensional geometrical ideas, the Mathai-Quillen form, and the projection form. Our presentation of these two forms relies on the algebraic structure of the Cartan model for equivariant cohomology. Then we will return to S⁢𝒜 and see that we have the same algebraic picture present, in the guise of the vector field 𝒬0 and in the twisted action (78).\n3.1.1. The Mathai-Quillen form In [10], Mathai and Quillen constructed a representative for the Euler class of a vector bundle that is built from a connection and a section. The proved that their form was closed and that its cohomology class depends neither on the section nor the connection. We will describe their construction now. Let G be a Lie group, let A be a principal G-bundle over a space B, and let E=A×ρV be an associated n-dimensional vector bundle, where ρ:G→G⁢L⁢(V) is a given representation. We are using finite dimensional A,B and G, but their names should suggest that we will eventually apply these ideas to the infinite dimensional spaces 𝒜, ℬ and 𝒢.\nLet d⁢ρ:𝔤→Hom⁢(V)≅Vect⁢(V) be the Lie algebra map to vector fields on V. We will denote by iϕ the contraction operator in the direction of d⁢ρ⁢(ϕ). The Cartan algebra is the space S*⁢(𝔤*)⊗Ω*⁢(V), equipped with a differential dC given by\n(83) dC⁢(ϕ⊗1) =0 (84) dC⁢(ϕ⊗ω) =1⊗(d-iϕ)⁢ω where ϕ is a generator of S*⁢(𝔤*), and one extends this formula to the full algebra by the Leibnitz rule. The cohomology of this complex computes the equivariant cohomology of V, HG*⁢(V). In case G acts freely, one has HG*⁢(V)≅H*⁢(V/G), so this algebraic model is designed to help handle the cases where the action is not free.\nTo make closer contact with our work on superconnections, we can describe the Cartan algebra using a vector field on an odd space.\nProposition 6. Let V be a vector space with inner product, together with an action of a Lie group G (not necessarily linear). Let a metric on g be given. Let {vi} be a basis of V and let {vi} be the dual basis. Define C⁢V=g×Π⁢T⁢V. Let a vector field Q on C⁢V be given by\nQ⁢(ϕivjλk)=(0λj-L⁢(ϕi)⁢vk)(ϕi,wj,λk) where ϕi is an element of a basis for g and λj is the basis element of Π⁢V≅Π⁢Tvj⁢V corresponding to vj. Then on the space S*⁢(g)⊗Ω*⁢(V), Q induces the action of the Cartan differential.\nProof. We have already discussed in Lemma 1 how C∞⁢(Π⁢T⁢V)≅Ω*⁢(V) and so taking the space of polynomial functions on 𝔤, we have S*⁢(𝔤*)⊗Ω*⁢(V)⊂C∞⁢(𝔤×Π⁢T⁢V). Q induces an action on this space by differentiation, and so to complete the proof we compute this induced action. Let us denote the superspace analogue of a differential form ω by ω^. So if\nω=ϕα⋅∑i1\u0026lt;⋯\u0026lt;ikai1⁢⋯⁢ik⁢(v)⁢d⁢vi1∧⋯∧d⁢vin is an element of the Cartan algebra, then the corresponding function on 𝔤×Π⁢T⁢V is\nω^=ϕα⋅∑i1\u0026lt;⋯\u0026lt;ikai1⁢⋯⁢ik⁢(v)⁢λi1⁢⋯⁢λin. ∎\nLet us compute the action of Q on ω^. We have\nQ⁢ω^ =∑ai1⁢⋯⁢ik⁢(-1)γ+1⁢λi1⁢⋯⁢λiγ-1⁢(-L⁢(ϕα)⁢vγ)⁢λiγ+1⁢⋯⁢λik (85) +ϕα⋅∑∂⁡ai1⁢⋯⁢ik∂⁡vγ⁢λγ⁢λi1⁢⋯⁢λin. Note that we computed only for a generator of S*⁢(𝔤*) but this suffices as both Q and the Cartan differential are extended in the same way (the Leibnitz rule) to more general elements. Under the correspondence with differential forms, λi→d⁢vi. Also, by the Cartan formula, L=d∘i+i∘d and so\n-L⁢(ϕα)⁢vγ=-i⁢(ϕα)⁢d⁢vγ. With these replacements, we can easily see from (85) that Q⁢ω^→(d-i⁢(ϕα))⁢ω, completing the proof.\nWe deliberately avoided using linearity of the G-action above, in order to be a little more general. However, in the case of a linear action (a representation) the action of ϕ on an element of V is just the vector field ϕ⁢(v)v.\nLet us examine the space L′⁢(A)=𝔤×Π⁢T⁢V×Π⁢V*×V*. (The number of components differs from the definition of L⁢(𝒜) above, hence the primed notation; the Π⁢T⁢V part of L′⁢(A) should be considered “extra” and we will see at the end of the section why its presence is not needed to discuss the Donaldson invariants.) We will install on this space the vector field\n(86) Q⁢(ϕvjλkψlEm)=(0λj-ϕ⁢(vk)El-ϕ⁢(ψm))(ϕi,vj,λk,ψl,Em). We will construct a special function ΨL on this space as follows. We will then integrate the exponential of the function Q⁢ΨL over the E and ψ variables, and we shall point out that the remaining function is Mathai and Quillen’s element of the Cartan algebra. Let us proceed. We set\n(87) ΨL⁢(ϕ,v,λ,ψ,E)=-i⁢ψ⁢(v)-⟨ψ,E⟩V* and then obtain\n(88) ΦL=Q⁢ΨL=-i⁢E⁢(v)+i⁢ψ⁢(λ)-⟨E,E⟩V*-⟨ψ,ϕ⁢(ψ)⟩V* (remembering to pick up a minus sign when we move Q past the ψ in the second term). Now we compute\nU⁢(ϕ,v,λ)=1(2⁢π)2⁢dim⁡V⁢∫V*×Π⁢V*𝑑vol⁢(E)⁢𝑑vol⁢(ψ)⁢eΦL. We now use the fact that Gaussian integration gives\n(89) ∫V𝑑vol⁢e-⟨v,A⁢v⟩+⟨B,v⟩ =∫V𝑑vol⁢e-14⁢⟨B,A-1⁢B⟩⁢e-⟨v-A-1⁢v,A⁢(v-A-1⁢v)⟩ (90) =e-14⁢⟨B,A-1⁢B⟩⁢(πdet⁡A)dim⁡V2 and obtain\n(91) U⁢(ϕ,v,λ)=1(4⁢π)dim⁡V⁢∫Π⁢V*𝑑vol⁢(ψ)⁢e-14⁢⟨v,v⟩V+i⁢ψ⁢(λ)-⟨ψ,ϕ⁢(ψ)⟩V* [[Note: Am I off by a minus sign on that third term in the exponential?]]\nTo obtain an element of the Cartan algebra, we use the fact that ΦL is a linear function of λ and so can be identified with a 1-form on V. If we now choose a connection a on A then we can construct the map w:S*⁢(𝔤*)⊗Ω*⁢(V)→Ω*⁢(P×V) by sending ϕ→Fa. This is the Weil homomorphism. It is an equivariant map because Fa transforms in the adjoint representation, and so descends to a map on G-invariant forms\nw¯:(S*⁢(𝔤*)⊗Ω*⁢(V))G→Ω*⁢(E). The form w⁢(U) is almost a representative of the Thom class 𝒯. In fact, w⁢(U) fails to be fully horizontal, which is required for it to be the lift of a form from E. Use the connection to decompose T(x,v)⁢(A×V) into Tx,vert⊕Tx,horiz⊕V and to form the projection p onto Tx,horiz⊕V. Then we denote\nw⁢(U)horiz⁢(X1,…,Xn)=w⁢(U)⁢(p⁢(X1),…,p⁢(Xn)). This horizontal element does in fact descend to Ω*⁢(E). The fact that U was already G-invariant but not horizontal perhaps indicates that the construction is better off living in the Weil model of equivariant cohomology, but we follow standard practice and take a horizontal projection. Note that we never had to use w¯, since we projected horizontally after applying w.\nTheorem 5 (Mathai-Quillen [10]). w⁢(U)horiz is a representative for the Thom class T.\nHeuristically, we see that the Berezinian integration over ψ will give us the Pfaffian of Fa, just as in the Gauss-Bonnet formula. The Gaussian in v and the constants ensure the integral over a fiber is 1. We obtain a top-dimensional form in the V direction because of the i⁢ψ⁢(λ) term and the correspondence between functions of λ and forms.\nNow we get back to the point about v and λ. The Thom class can be pulled back by a section s:B→E to produce the Euler class of E. This is an n-form on B (recall that dim⁡V=n), unless n\u0026gt;dim⁡B in which case the Euler class is defined to be zero. We can pull the Mathai-Quillen form back to B by s to obtain (92) s*⁢U⁢(ϕ,v,λ)=1(4⁢π)dim⁡V⁢∫Π⁢V*𝑑vol⁢(ψ)⁢e-14⁢⟨s,s⟩V+i⁢ψ⁢(d⁢s)-⟨ψ,ϕ⁢(ψ)⟩V* where we simply replaced v by s and λ by d⁢s to effect the pullback. This form represents the Euler class of E.\nIf we replace the section s by t⁢s for a real parameter t and rescale ψ by ψ→1t⁢ψ then this expression becomes\n(93) s*⁢U⁢(ϕ,v,λ)=1(4⁢π)dim⁡V⁢∫Π⁢V*𝑑vol⁢(ψ)⁢e-14⁢t2⁢⟨s,s⟩V+i⁢ψ⁢(d⁢s)-t2⁢⟨ψ,ϕ⁢(ψ)⟩V*. This version allows us to consider the two limits t→0 and t→∞ that link the Gauss-Bonnet formula with a formula that involves local data at the zero set of s. We will now see that our action on S⁢𝒜 has an Euler class part that is the pullback by FA+:ℬ→𝒜×𝒢Ω+2⁢(X;ad⁢P). Under the identification of Ω2+ with V* and Lie⁢𝒢 with 𝔤, we identify E2 with E, ψ2 with ψ and ϕ with i⁢ϕ. So L⁢(𝒜) is an analogous space to the one we were just considering. Now let us compare (93) with the action (78). If we choose the section s to be the map\n12⁢FA+:𝒜→𝒜×Ω2+⁢(X;ad⁢P) then d⁢s will take ψ1 to dA+⁢ψ1. Also, the action of Lie⁢𝒢 on Ω2+ is ψ2↦[ϕ,ψ2] and so the analogy with (93) gives\n(94) (t⁢FA+)*⁢U=∫Π⁢(Ω2+⁢(X;ad⁢P))𝑑ψ2⁢e-t24⁢|FA+|2+i⁢⟨ψ2,dA+⁢ψ1⟩-1t2⁢⟨ψ2,[ϕ,ψ2]⟩ which is part of (78) with t replaced by 1/g. So not only does part of the twisted action represent the Poincaré dual of the ASD moduli space, but the physical coupling constant plays an analogous role to the scale of the section FA+! We will dwell on this after discussing the projection form. 3.1.2. The projection form The construction of the projection form follows in the same vein as the Mathai-Quillen construction above. We will introduce a space together with a vector field. We will differentiate a function to obtain another function that we then exponentiate as before, and integrate over some of the variables. This form will interact with the Mathai-Quillen form, as they will share certain variables. In fact, the projection form will enforce both of the modifications we made to U above: it will kill off all but the horizontal part of U and it will produce a δ-function that is supported where ϕ is equal to the curvature of the chosen connection (the construction of the projection form involves a choice of connection).\nLet A→B be a principal bundle with group G. Let ⟨,⟩𝔤 be an bi-invariant inner product on 𝔤. Suppose we are given a G-equivariant metric g on A. Then g induces a natural connection on B by using the metric to take the horizontal distribution to be the orthogonal complement of the vertical one. The action of the group G on A induces a map from 𝔤 to the vertical tangent spaces of A. We call this map C, so we have C:𝔤→Ta⁢A. Using the metric, we can define the adjoint C* of C, C*:Ta⁢A→𝔤. In other words, C* is a Lie algebra-valued 1-form on A.\nWe will examine the space\nP⁢(A)=𝔤×A×Π⁢Ω1⁢(X;ad⁢P)×𝔤×Π⁢𝔤 with the vector field\n(95) Q′⁢(ϕaψ′ϕ¯ψ¯)=(0ψ′-L⁢(ϕ)⁢aψ¯-L⁢(ϕ)⁢ϕ¯)(ϕ,a,ψ′,ϕ¯,ψ¯). We begin with the element\n(96) ΨP⁢(ϕ,a,ψ′,ϕ¯,ψ¯)=i⁢⟨ϕ¯,C*⟩𝔤. We won’t be able to compute Q′⁢Ψ with just (95), though. This is because C* is a genuine 1-form, not an odd object. However, by Proposition 6 we can work with the Cartan differential which operates by (d-i⁢(ϕ))⁢C*=d⁢C*-C*⁢(C⁢ϕ). And so we have\n(97) ΦP=Q′⁢ΨP=i⁢⟨ψ¯,C*⟩𝔤+i⁢⟨ϕ¯,d⁢C*⟩𝔤-i⁢⟨ϕ¯,C*⁢(C⁢ϕ)⟩𝔤. The projection form is then\n(98) U′⁢(ϕ,a,ψ′)=1(2⁢π⁢i)dim⁡G⁢∫𝔤×Π⁢𝔤𝑑vol⁢(ϕ¯)⁢𝑑vol⁢(ψ¯)⁢ei⁢⟨ψ¯,C*⟩𝔤+i⁢⟨ϕ¯,d⁢C*⟩𝔤-i⁢⟨ϕ¯,C*⁢(C⁢ϕ)⟩𝔤 which lies in S*⁢(𝔤*)⊗Ω*⁢(A).\nProposition 7. Let ω be an element of S*⁢(g*)⊗Ω*⁢(V) for some vector space V with G-action. Then ∫g𝑑ϕ⁢ω∧U′=w⁢(ω)horiz\nProof. For a more detailed treatment of U′, see Section 14.3.3 of [6]. The Berezinian integral over ψ¯ picks off the piece of maximal degree in ψ¯. If dim⁡G=m then this yields an m-form built from the m-fold wedge product of C*. Since C* is a vertical 1-form (it vanishes on horizontal vectors in T⁢A) this wedge product is an m-form along strictly vertical directions. In fact, it is an element of ∧top(Tvert*⁢A). Any form on A with components along vertical directions is zero when wedged with such a fully vertical form, and so multiplying ω by U′ picks off the horizontal part of U′.\nNext, we note that the integral over ϕ¯ in U′ gives the δ-function\nδ⁢(d⁢C*-C*⁢(C⁢ϕ)) which is zero unless\nϕ=(C*⁢C)-1⁢d⁢C*. Lemma 6. (C*⁢C)-1⁢d⁢C* is the horizontal part of the curvature two-form F on B induced from the connection induced from the metric g on A.\nNow let us examine the analogous objects over 𝒜 and again compare with (78). We need to do a couple of computations first to get the right expressions. Here we follow [1]. First, the operator C* is a Lie⁢𝒢-valued 1-form on 𝒜, and a standard formula from gauge theory gives for a connection A\nC*⁢(A)⁢(η)=dA*⁢(η) where η∈Ω1⁢(X;ad⁢P). Similarly, the map C, which is a map from Lie⁢𝒢 into T⁢𝒜 is given by\nϕ↦dA⁢ϕ for ϕ∈Ω0⁢(X;ad⁢P)≅Lie⁢𝒢.\nWhat about the map d⁢C*? This will be a 2-form on 𝒜, and we can argue as follows. In finite dimensions, if a 1-form is given by ∑fi⁢(x)⁢d⁢xi then\nd⁢(∑fi⁢(x)⁢d⁢xi)=∑∂⁡fi∂⁡xj⁢d⁢xj∧d⁢xi, so what we are looking to do is differentiate dA* in the A direction. Let ϕ¯∈Lie⁢𝒢. Consider the expression ⟨ϕ¯,C*⟩. On an element Y1∈T⁢𝒜 this function gives\n⟨ϕ¯,dA*⁢Y1⟩=⟨dA⁢ϕ,Y1⟩. Differentiating this in the direction of the tangent vector Y2 gives\n⟨[Y2,ϕ¯],Y1⟩. The invariance of the metric under the adjoint action of Lie⁢𝒢 implies\n⟨[Y2,ϕ¯],Y1⟩=⟨ϕ¯,[Y1,*Y2]⟩. This is the 2-form ⟨ϕ¯,d⁢c*⟩ evaluated on Y1 and Y2, and now we wish to express this as a quadratic function on Π⁢T⁢𝒜. If ψ1∈Π⁢T⁢𝒜 then the corresponding function is just\n(99) ⟨ϕ¯,[ψ1,*ψ1]⟩. And so the analog of the projection form is\n(100) U′=∫Lie⁢𝒢×Π⁢Lie⁢𝒢D⁢ϕ¯⁢D⁢ψ0⁢ei⟨ψ0,dA*ψ1⟩+i⟨ϕ¯,[ψ1,*ψ1]⟩-i⟨ϕ¯,dA*dAϕ⟩ which forms another part of the action (78).\nWe have not discussed two of the terms in (78). Those are -i⁢|E2|2 and i⁢⟨ϕ,[ψ0,ψ0]⟩. These two terms are not used in the analogy with geometry that we have just constructed, but nor do they pose a problem. In fact, if one enforces the classical equations of motion for the auxiliary field E2 one obtains\n-i⁢|E2|2→-i⁢|[ϕ,ϕ¯]|2, which we will not prove. The quantity\n-i⁢|[ϕ,ϕ¯]|2+i⁢⟨ϕ,[ψ0,ψ0]⟩ is in the image of a Cartan differential, just as the rest of the action was shown to be above. However, in this case passing to equivariant cohomology actually kills off these two terms, and so they are not important to our story. The [ϕ,ϕ¯] term is of crucial importance in studying the classical and quantum vacua of the physical theory on flat space.\n3.2. Path integrals Consider a path integral of the form\n∫fieldse-Sq+∑igi⁢SI,i where the various SI,i are interaction terms, which just means they are each a cubic or higher order function on field space. Sq is a quadratic function on field space. Such an integral can be written as a formal power series in the gi, the coupling coefficients. This series does not converge, and each term in the series diverges unless we renormalize. So what we’re dealing with here is no better off mathematically than the Thom class idea is. However, the constant term (independent of all gi) is computed by evaluating only the quadratic part Sq of the action, which is a Gaussian integral that can be rigorously defined using zeta function regularization of determinants and Pfaffians of infinite-dimensional operators. So, in the limit as the coupling parameters vanish, the quadratic part is the whole of the path integral. This is a free theory, which means it models a theory of particles that do not interact with each other.\nOur theory has one coupling parameter, g and so to compute the free path integral we’d be taking the limit g→0. Furthermore, if an action has a moduli space of minima, one computes terms in the perturbation expansion by integrating over this moduli space and projecting the path integral onto the normal bundle of this space. That would be how we’d compute the Donaldson invariants as path integrals, too. The quadratic part of the action acting on the normal bundle to ℳ∈ℬ has quadratic part consisting of the Laplacian dA*⁢dA on even objects and dA or dA* on fermions. When carefully computed, the resulting determinants and Pfaffians of these operators will cancel up to sign, the details of the sign depending on considerations involving the orientation of ℳ.\nSomething very special is happening here, though. The reciprocal of the coupling parameter plays the same role as the scale of the section FA+, as we saw when we compared (78) and (94). And so low coupling corresponds to taking the scale to infinity. The algorithm we use at low coupling to compute the path integral aligns exactly with the steepest descent computation one uses to show that the Mathai-Quillen form can be expressed in terms of local data on the zero set of the section.\nAtiyah and Jeffrey made a related statement in [1]. They pointed out that the Mathai-Quillen construction could allow the definition of a regularized Euler class. Even if the base space and vector bundle are infinite-dimensional, if we choose a section that has a finite-dimensional zero set M, then we can define the regularized Euler class in terms of M. This is similar to saying that one can define a path integral at zero coupling. Perhaps results in either the path integral direction or the Thom class direction can inform the other.\n3.3. The quantum observables 𝒪(i) If we want to do intersection theory on the zero set of FA+ then we are all ready, because we have an Euler class to wedge forms against, which is equivalent to integrating the forms over the Poincaré dual of the Euler class, which is of course exactly the zero set in question. To do this within the field theory framework, we need superspace representatives of the forms used in Donaldson theory. These involve slant products with a Pontrjagin class, and so we will find a field theory representative for this construction.\nThe following is a standard construction from Donaldson theory. See [4] for more details. Let P→X be a principal S⁢U⁢(2) bundle over an even riemannian four-manifold X. We denote by 𝒜 the space of connections and by 𝒢 the group of gauge transformations. Let 𝒜* and ℬ* be the respective complements of the set of reducible connections. Let ℬ*=𝒜*/𝒢. The bundle\nℙ=𝒜*×𝒢P→ℬ*×X is a principal S⁢O⁢(3) bundle, and so has a first Pontrjagin class p1⁢(ℙ). We define a connection on this bundle by using a metric as follows. Give 𝒜×{p} the usual metric on 𝒜 and give {A}×P a metric by using the metric on X for horizontal vectors, and the connection A together with a metric on Lie⁢𝒢 for vertical vectors. There is an associated connection given by taking the orthogonal complements of the vertical subspaces of T⁢(𝒜*×P). The curvature of this connection, ℱ, is given by the following formulas. Let τ1 and τ2 be horizontal tangents to 𝒜 at A, and let X1 and X2 be horizontal tangents to P at p. Then one computes\n(101) ℱ2,0⁢(A,p)⁢(τ1,τ2) =-1dA*⁢dA⁢dA*⁢([τ1,τ2]) (102) ℱ1,1⁢(A,p)⁢(τ1,X1) =τ1⁢(X1) (103) ℱ0,2⁢(A,p)⁢(X1,X2) =FA⁢(X1,X2). The subscripted indices denote the bigrading in H*⁢(ℬ*×X). The bracket [τ1,τ2] is a bracket of two vector fields on 𝒜, not the bracket as sections of ad⁢P.\nTo see how to create a superspace representation 𝔽 of ℱ, we just need to come up with an equivariant representative of each of these three 2-forms. The generator ϕ of S*⁢(Lie⁢𝒢*) maps to the curvature ℱ2,0 under the Weil map, and so properly interpreted, ϕ is 𝔽2,0. What the generator ϕ means written alone is the identity function on Lie⁢𝒢. This is the element\nϕ∈Lie⁢𝒢*×Lie⁢𝒢≅Lie⁢𝒢*×Ω0⁢(X;ad⁢P). Similarly the expression “ψ1,” when written in isolation, is an identity function, this time on Π⁢T⁢𝒜. That makes ψ1 a vector-valued function on Π⁢T⁢𝒜. Under the correspondence with forms, this becomes a vector-valued 1-form corresponding to the identity function on tangent vectors, otherwise known as de Rham d. So, ψ1↔d, which can be evaluated on a pair (τ1,X1) as above to give\nd:(τ1,X1)→(τ1,X1) which is the identity, yielding a tangent vector to the space of connections and a tangent vector to the manifold. And so the final evaluation of ψ1 is\nτ1⁢(X1) giving the identification between ψ1 and ℱ1,1. FA is already a field in our theory and so we obtain\n(104) 𝔽2,0 =ϕ (105) 𝔽1,1 =ψ1 (106) 𝔽0,2 =FA. It is worthwhile to note that if we compute the action of the vector field induced by Q1 on ϕ we obtain\n(107) 𝒬1⁢ϕ=ψ1𝒬1⁢ψ1=FA+𝒬0⁢(F⁢(d,D1)) so that if we compute modulo 𝒬0 (i.e. we work on the level of equivariant cohomology and not equivariant forms) then 𝒬1 permutes bigraded pieces of 𝔽, keeping total grading invariant.\nThe Pontrjagin class p1⁢(ℙ) is given by\np1⁢(ℙ)=12⁢Tr⁢(ℱ∧ℱ), and so we will examine the equivariant representative\n12⁢Tr⁢(𝔽∧𝔽). To compute the slant product with an i-dimensional homology class, we just integrate a bigraded piece over a smooth representative. So Donaldson’s μ-map is\nμ⁢([Σi])=p1⁢(ℙ)/[Σi]=∫Σi(12⁢Tr⁢(𝔽∧𝔽))4-i,i. For the record we list the bigraded pieces\n(108) p1⁢(ℙ)4,0 =12⁢Tr⁢(ϕ2) (109) p1⁢(ℙ)3,1 =Tr⁢(ϕ⁢ψ1) (110) p1⁢(ℙ)2,2 =Tr⁢(12⁢ψ1∧ψ1+ϕ⁢FA) (111) p1⁢(ℙ)1,3 =Tr⁢(ψ1∧FA) (112) p1⁢(ℙ)0,4 =12⁢Tr⁢(FA∧FA) 3.4. The path integral formulation of the polynomial invariants We already know that the projection form part of the path integral can be evaluated formally and gives the Weil homomorphism from equivariant cohomology to usual cohomology, by mapping ϕ to the curvature of a connection. And so we may use supersymmetric equivariant representatives for p1 in the construction of a path integral, knowing that they will be mapped to the real thing. Thus we can construct a completely physical analogue of Donaldson theory, by integrating local operators over a space of fields, against the exponential of an action that is also built from local fields. Let 𝒪(i)=p1⁢(ℙ)4-i,i be the equivariant representatives and let D be the Donaldson polynomial on second homology. We have hopefully motivated the following claim.\nClaim 1. The gaussian approximation to the path integral\n∫S⁢𝒜(∏k=1N∫Σik𝒪(ik))⁢exp⁡(-S) agrees with the Donaldson polynomial\nD⁢(Σi1,…,ΣiN)=∫ℳμ⁢([Σi1])∧⋯∧μ⁢([ΣiN]). 4. Outlook: Witten’s conjecture This work is the beginning of a program. The goal is to prove Witten’s conjecture [18]. The physical insight that allowed Witten to make this remarkable conjecture comes from his celebrated paper with Seiberg [14]. My hope is that one day a mathematical version of that paper may be created, and this work marks the humble beginnings of that project.\nIt may be possible to prove Witten’s conjecture using nonabelian monopoles ([12], [8], [7]). However, a proof that parallels the physical proof would have the advantage that it may reveal a broader picture of math/physics interaction, and help us to understand why so much recent mathematics has grown out of physics. In particular, it may shed light on either the mathematical relevance or the mathematical underpinnings of the renormalization group.\nHowever, for that we need more mathematics. We have tried to cast Donaldson theory in physical language, along the lines that Witten hinted at in 1988 [17]. That was the starting point for Seiberg and Witten’s breakthrough work of 1994 [14], and so it needs to be the starting point for the mathematical proof as well. Hopefully after reading this paper this picture of Donaldson theory seems somewhat natural from a mathematical standpoint. From a physical standpoint, it is simply a supersymmetric gauge theory, and the Minkowski space version (the “physical” theory, as it’s known, as opposed to the twisted theory, which is called “topological” or “cohomological”) can be treated with all the machinery of modern physics. As of 1994, there wasn’t enough physics to understand this theory any better than we have already done in this paper. However, Seiberg and Witten created new physics that solved the theory. To understand what that means, we need to discuss energy scales.\n4.1. Energy scale and the renormalization group We have discussed the coupling parameter that appears in both the physical and twisted gauge theory actions. We talked about how the constant term in the coupling expansion (the perturbation series) is the appropriate Donaldson invariant. We did not address what controls the value of the coupling constant or whether it is simply arbitrary. In fact\nClaim 2. Let γt=e-t⁢γ be a one-parameter family of metrics on E4. Then as t blows up, the coupling parameter g responds by shrinking to zero. In other words, g is a function of t and we have\nlimt→∞⁡g⁢(t)=0. This follows from the asymptotic freedom of nonabelian gauge theories. The significance of the metric scaling to zero is in the fact that this is the regime of high energy. Using the speed of light and Planck’s constant, meters and energy units can be converted back and forth, just as meters and seconds can be converted using just the speed of light. Small distances correspond to large energy units, and so shrinking the metric to zero examines the theory at high energy. In this paper we have therefore examined correlation functions at the high energy limit, since as the energy approaches infinity, the coupling goes all the way to zero, leaving only the Donaldson invariants. On the other hand, the perturbation expansion, which is borderline meaningless anyway, only stands a chance of converging if the coupling is small, and so physicists believe that asymptotically free theories at high energy are quite under their control to compute with.\nPhysicists, however, would have us make the following analogy. Take some fundamental model of the basic forces of nature, like string theory or the standard model. These are hugely complicated asymptotically free theories that describe the behavior of our universe at the highest of energies and the smallest of distance scales. They are “fundamental” in that sense — they are the underlying physics of everything. However, more often than not we are interested in more mundane matters like fluid flows or planetary mechanics. In these cases, we are working on rather larger distance scales, and quite tiny energy regimes. The laws of physics are surprisingly simpler in this sort of context, becoming things like Kepler’s laws or the Navier-Stokes equations. These are not gauge theories or string theories with infinitely many degrees of freedom. They are finite-dimensional PDEs or algebraic equations that, while perhaps difficult to solve completely, are provincial and comparatively easy to understand. The conceptual force at work here is the renormalization group, first understood in this way by Wilson [15], [13]. The renormalization group is simply the group of energy scaling. It is the t parameter in the above theorem. While the underlying group is simple, its action on a theory is not. Somehow, as it flows from high energy to low, the complexities of the fundamental theory are suppressed, and only a few parameters and degrees of freedom survive at low energy. We are not going to try to understand the renormalization group and its workings, but instead we are just trying to paint the picture that is in the back of all physicists’ minds. There is no overarching description of the renormalization group, no actual flow that can be applied to a theory to get answers at different scales. It is something that is ill-understood at best, though perhaps the route to addressing it and constructing a workable theory is via the sort of topological application we are discussing here!\nWitten makes the analogy [16] between a fundamental, asymptotically free theory, and a differential equation. The former contains infinitesimally small distance information about a theory, as we said before, and so the analogy with information about a function’s derivatives is very close. The ability to describe a theory at any energy scale is, then, analogous to solving the differential equation. Nonabelian gauge theories are therefore candidate “problems,” and the challenge is to find their “solutions.” Donaldson theory is asymptotically free because it is an S⁢U⁢(2) gauge theory. Its correlation functions are the Donaldson polynomials, and the challenge in terms of renormalization is to compute these correlation functions at all energies, and solve Donaldson theory. Mathematics has no basis for even stating this challenging problem. Donaldson theory is not a question at all in its mathematical presentation. It is simply a construction that yields interesting information. But physics goes further, and places it at one end of the real numbers, near infinity, because that is where it fits in terms of energy scale. Of what picture is this the limit? No one has addressed this question. What has been addressed, though, is what lies at the other end of the line, at zero energy. The answer: Seiberg-Witten invariants. Abelian gauge theories are the opposite of asymptotically free: the coupling parameter vanishes for low energy (the t→-∞ limit in the above theorem). These are called infrared free theories. Infrared free theories are, then, the candidates for the solutions to asymptotically free ones. They are well-behaved as perturbation series only near zero energy. Seiberg-Witten theory is a theory of a U⁢(1) gauge field coupled to a spinor, and so is an abelian gauge theory. As such it is infrared free, and is one of a host of candidates for solutions to Donaldson theory. In fact, Seiberg and Witten show that it is exactly the right solution.\n4.2. Overview of the physics proof To describe the physics proof of the conjecture would be too vast an undertaking for this paper, and so we merely sketch it, pointing out some of the deep issues that will need confronting. First of all, the result does not involve the twisted theory we have considered here, but rather the N=2 Minkowski space version. However, Witten’s conjecture clearly involves assuming that the flow to low energy commutes with the twisting operation, as one simply twists the low energy physical theory to obtain the Seiberg-Witten invariants. The good news then is that we have learned all the mathematical tools needed to twist the low energy physical theory in the preceding sections of this paper. The bad news is that it may not be possible to cast a workable parallel of the flow to low energy in twisted terms.\nThe central issue to sort out, however, is the concept of the quantum vacuum. In classical physics, the minima of the action form the classical vacuum manifold. The action principal states that a physical system will assume one of the configurations from this space. In quantum physics, a system can assume any of the states in the whole field space, but the path integral weighs minima of the action with much higher probability. To turn the crank of quantum field theory, one must select a classical vacuum and write the action in coordinates that perturb from this state. The quantum vacuum for this theory is then a state in the theory’s Hilbert space that has no particles, or is invariant under the entire Poincaré group. This indirect definition makes it hard to quantify, especially because it is difficult or impossible to actually construct this Hilbert space! Certain details of the theory influence whether the quantum vacuum is unique or not. In the case of our S⁢U⁢(2) theory, the classical vacuum manifold is the complex plane modulo the action of z↦z2, with the resulting cone singularity at the origin. It is believed that the quantum vacuum manifold is this same space, but with a different metric and other properties. This is a guess. There is currently no way to ascertain the validity of this, even physically. However, if one assumes a whole lot about physical theories and what sort of perturbations of classical vacua are permitted to arise from quantization, then it is the simplest guess. There are singularities on the quantum vacuum manifold as well, but there are two of them, and neither of them is at z=0. The whole of the matter revolves around proving what this manifold is, what metric it has, and what the monodromies of the coupling parameter around the singularities are. Other details are important too, however. Seiberg and Witten claim that there are “BPS states” in each theory of the quantum manifold, and that the mass of these states is different in each theory. The two singularities are the two points where this mass vanishes. That is what is making the metric blow up at those points, they claim. A BPS state is by definition a vector in the Hilbert space that is annihilated by half of the eight supersymmetry operators (which act on the Hilbert space), so this object, which is some sort of soliton, should be quite tractable mathematically. Perhaps this is the way to access a mathematical theory about quantum vacua and the conjecture.\nReferences [1] M. Atiyah and L. Jeffrey (1990) Topological Lagrangians and cohomology.

Supersymmetry in flat space is defined and the twist homomorphism is constructed, giving us a supermanifold that is the total space of an odd vector bundle over the even 4-manifold. A special category of connections on this space is defined and a decomposition into so-called component fields is proved. The twisted supersymmetric action is computed, and the structure of the action, the decomposition, and the action of a special odd vector field are all shown to have a rich geometrical structure that was partially interpred by Atiyah and Jeffrey. In short, the action is an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Euler class of the vector bundle of self-dual 2-forms over the space of connections mod gauge. This geometrical insight serves two purposes: first, it motivates the study of anti-self-dual connections, intersection theory, and the action of the group of gauge transformations, all of which appear by themselves after the twist. Secondly, it sets the stage for an eventual proof of Witten's Conjecture, relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants. What we build here amounts to a mathematical treatment of a physical treatment of a mathematical construction of Donaldson.","tags":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics - Differential Geometry"],"title":"A Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory Formulation of the Donaldson Polynomial Invariants","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Tech"],"content":"So langmead.info seems relatively stable at the moment.

This allows you to fill in some of the middle squares, which then give you information about the columns.\n","date":1015380303,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1015380303,"objectID":"ffd6e294baf56f79e8bb049fafd63c8b","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2002-03-06-so-the-paint-by-numbers-project-named/","publishdate":"2002-03-06T02:05:03Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2002-03-06-so-the-paint-by-numbers-project-named/","section":"posts","summary":"So the Paint-by-Numbers project, named Go-Gan, is proceeding.

Visit this Japanese site for some examples to try.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to write the app in Cocoa, the native environment for Mac OS X. In fact, this is just my excuse to learn Cocoa. When Apple computer bought Steve Jobs\u0026rsquo; company Next in 1995 (?), they did so to obtain the sophisticated Nextstep operating system. This became Mac OS X, and the then-revolutionary Nextstep programming framework became Cocoa. Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser, wrote all of it using Nextstep. Why? Because it was easy, supposedly. I\u0026rsquo;ve explored it a little bit and I find it very exciting. It is easy in the sense that many things come for free, as in Java, but it is also hard in that it leaves me running to the documentation all the time \u0026ndash; once I commit the core of Cocoa to memory, this will disappear as well and it probably will seem easy.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll write the engine in C++, though, not Objective-C (the language you have to use to use Cocoa). The engine will include the abstraction of what a Paint-by-Numbers puzzle is, and the things the player can do to it. Actually wiring that up to a user of the app will be another layer, the user interface layer. This layer will listen to mouse clicks and whatnot, and will then call the appropriate message in the engine.\nFor example, the most common way to interact with the puzzle will be to click on a square cell. When the click is heard, I will have to compute which square on the screen it was in, and therefore which abstract cell it is. Then, I will ask the abstract \u0026ldquo;paint by numbers cell object,\u0026rdquo; which is invisible to the user, to alter its state (turn it black, for example). Then, I\u0026rsquo;ll have the representation of the cell on the screen update accordingly, by asking the abstract cell what color it is now.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still working out the architecture, but I should have some progress by day\u0026rsquo;s end.

There was actually a fight over allowing the flag from the top of the WTC to make an appearance during the ceremonies. Give me a break! If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that important before 9/11, then it is exactly that important today, no more and no less.

Did you know that? Let me explain.\nE-book is obviously short for electronic book. This sounds like a nineteenth century name for what it is: a computer file. In such a computer file are the contents of a book. For example, a Word document with Pride and Prejudice in it is an e-book. So is a plain text file of the same book, or a web page or any other format. The point is that the environment where the book is read is a digital computer environment. There are a few issues about e-books that I think are important. First, there is the issue of reading an entire book on a screen. Despite that, I am obsessed with reading e-books, so I will explain why. Finally, what does the future hold for e-books?\nThe detractors say that e-books are not going to be widely read until they appear on screens that are much fancier than our low-resolution devices of today. A typical computer monitor has fewer than 100 pixels per inch of screen, so the most precise unit of measurement is 1/100 inch. Book printing is done at a much higher resolution, and so the character shapes (\u0026lsquo;glyphs\u0026rsquo; in technical jargon) are very detailed lovely curves, compared to the collections of dots that you get on a screen. It is generally thought that it is easier to read the high-resolution text than the low. Moreover, monitors and laptop displays are backlit, where a book uses reflected light. Monitors blink at around 60-100 times per second, which can give you a headache (though laptop displays do not blink at all, which makes them more comfortable). All this adds up to a reading experience that tires your eyes pretty quickly. In the future, we may have \u0026ldquo;digital ink,\u0026rdquo; which is an umbrella term for a number of emerging technologies that work much more like a book. These would have a sheet of material that would feel like paper or plastic, but would be digital in that each page would have electrical current and a grid of extremely tiny pixels, such that the resolution was maybe as high as 1200 pixels per inch. Some sort of computer chip, maybe embedded right in the page, would turn pixels on and off and set them to different colors, to produce a document as lovely as a printed page.\nOkay, so if reading electronic text is so awful, and can give you a headache, why do you read them? Well, my e-books don\u0026rsquo;t give me a headache. I read them on my Palm, and it neither blinks nor is backlit. The Palm screen works using reflected light just like page, or more to the point a digital watch. It has black LCD pixels on a light gray background, so it has high contrast and no flickering. When it\u0026rsquo;s dark, I do turn on the backlighting, and it indeed gives me a headache before too long. As for the pixellated fonts, they don\u0026rsquo;t bother me. I have a selection of fonts on my Palm and I have chosen ones that were very well designed to take advantage of the pixellation.\nThere is an art to making text readable at low resolution \u0026ndash; compare some of the fonts on your computer at small point sizes and see which ones you think had readability at small sizes as a design goal.\nSo the problems I mentioned before don\u0026rsquo;t bother me. What\u0026rsquo;s so great, though? Why read an e-book instead of a paper book? E-books are one of those things that don\u0026rsquo;t make as much sense before you use them as they do after. Computers and the Internet required the same kind of transition, for example. But I can give you some of the reasons that reading books on my Palm lead to this je ne sais quoi. The main one is that the Palm holds several books. That means that without carrying anything extra around, I have several novels. (And the Palm itself is very slight and is always with me anyway, for notes and To Do\u0026rsquo;s and names and addresses and the like.) If I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in line at the bank, or on a bus, or waiting for Alison to find some pants at Old Navy, I can (and do) slip my Palm out of my pocket and resume reading right were I left off. I have one of the buttons on the front re-assigned to launching my e-book program, so that I can perform all of this with just my thumb. If you like reading, then the idea of bringing your books that much closer and having them that much more accessible will make sense to you, too.\nAnother plus is the ability to read with one hand. I can use my thumb to scroll to the next page if I hold my Palm upside-down and rotate the display as well (screen orientation is an option in my e-book reader). This works great at meals, and when straphanging on public transportation. You can search for text too, which I\u0026rsquo;ve used to remind myself of past actions in the story, or to re-read a passage where a character was first introduced (oh, he\u0026rsquo;s her uncle). Finally, the backlighting is a boon for married folks. The dim light doesn\u0026rsquo;t disturb your bedmate, and so it solves the \u0026ldquo;reading in bed problem\u0026rdquo; for me. Like I said, though, it gets hard on my eyes within about 20 minutes. Your mileage may vary.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re sold on e-books, let me warn you off a little bit. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to get them. If you want to see the best store there is, and it\u0026rsquo;s good but it\u0026rsquo;s no Amazon, then visit Peanutpress.com. They are owned by Palm and they have a pretty large selection, six or seven of which I\u0026rsquo;ve bought and downloaded. I hope that the future brings great growth to this and other vendors. What\u0026rsquo;s to lose? They do a one-time translation from the electronic source of the printed book into an e-book, and they sell each copy for $6, without having to make any books. The economics are there, so it\u0026rsquo;s just the usual chicken-and-egg market size story: the market isn\u0026rsquo;t there until there are lots of customers, but customers aren\u0026rsquo;t drawn until there are lots of books. Peanutpress is forging the way by selling all these books into a tiny market. There are more e-publishing ventures than there were a couple of years ago, though. The publishing houses have set up some online e-book stores, but they seem mainly geared to books that don\u0026rsquo;t also get printed the old way. This give the impression that they are second-rate fare, not good enough to publish as \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; books. Still, this means they are giving a voice to authors that they can\u0026rsquo;t afford to publish any other way (presumably), and more voices is good (as long as they aren\u0026rsquo;t spewing crap).\nI have read a lot more than five or six e-books, though. I\u0026rsquo;ve read about 20 novels this way, and I\u0026rsquo;m reading one now with four more lined up. How did I do that? It\u0026rsquo;s pretty interesting, really. First I buy the book at a bookstore. I put it on my shelf and I never open it. Then, I go online (using Limewire usually, which is a Gnutella client) and I type in the author\u0026rsquo;s name. Often a list of text files pops up, and sometimes even fancier formats like RTF (which has formatting and bold and italic fonts) or HTML. These are created by someone with a \u0026ldquo;book scanner,\u0026rdquo; which is a regular scanner plus a page feeder. They cut off the spine of a book and feed all the pages in. The software puts the images in the right order and does character recognition on it, and makes a text file. These are then distributed over the internet for folks to download. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly like the way music and movies are pirated online, and it violates all the same copyright laws. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad, though, because I buy the book and merely use this technique to \u0026ldquo;move it onto my Palm.\u0026rdquo; Am I bad for doing that? I can\u0026rsquo;t tell, but I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad.\nLet me wrap this up by indicating some of the ideas that I consider to be at the fringe of e-books. Some will tell you that dedicated e-book readers like the Gemstar e-book are what e-books are about. These devices are crippled compared to a Palm or other handheld. They are too big, too expensive, and they control what content you can install. You cannot convert one of your own text files or web pages to an appropriate format and load it onto the Gemstar, like you can with a Palm.\nAnother non-e-book line of thinking are the Adobe E-book reader and the Microsoft Reader. These are programs for your laptop or desktop machine, and so they are lacking the two main requirements of e-books: portability and reflective screens. I can curl up on the sofa with a cup of coffee and my Palm. If I were a PocketPC user (like Palms only with a Microsoft operating system) I\u0026rsquo;d be very disappointed right now. You can get lots of books in the Microsoft Reader format, but only a subset of those can be used with the Pocket PC version of the Reader. I can\u0026rsquo;t understand why, unless it\u0026rsquo;s because they have hard-coded line breaks that don\u0026rsquo;t work on the smaller pocket-sized screen. But that\u0026rsquo;s not a good enough reason \u0026ndash; make the line breaking dynamic and get the books on the handhelds!\n","date":1005269343,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1005269343,"objectID":"3293a49ac7901202921203b38957303c","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/2001-11-09-my-e-book-obsession/","publishdate":"2001-11-09T01:29:03Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2001-11-09-my-e-book-obsession/","section":"posts","summary":" I HAVE AN E-BOOK OBSESSION!

I can\u0026rsquo;t really do anything about the speed of light, and I feel quite powerless to affect taxes, as I live in a city that charges almost as much in income tax as the state it\u0026rsquo;s in (Hint: this state is the most populous on the east coast and charges a buttload in both income and sales tax, and the city shares its name). So, that leaves death. Now there I can at least do some explaining.\nI have an analytical mind (nooooooo!). I like to reason things out, and so as my tiny being tries to grasp the true nature of life and death, it grabs on to little morsels. This particular morsel I want to share is so tiny, so not helpful, that it\u0026rsquo;s almost a waste. But it seems to explain a lot to me anyway, so I\u0026rsquo;ll carry on\u0026hellip;\nThe issue at hand is the following.\nResolved: People tend to feel their life slipping past them faster and faster as they get older. Middle-aged folks may even feel decades slip by at a time. As our store of patience grows, so does our tendency to allow time to pass in large chunks. Our lives speed up.\nThe solution to this paradox is the following logical deduction: If a \u0026lt; b then c/a \u0026gt; c/b. (Okay, okay, so long as c is positive.) The way to read that more relevantly is, \u0026ldquo;If you are younger than me (a \u0026lt; b) then c days seems longer to you than to me (c/a \u0026gt; c/b).\u0026rdquo; So the fractions\nc/a and c/b represent the fraction of our total lives so far that waiting for c days represents. For example, if you are four years old, then waiting for a toy for a week represents waiting around 0.5% of the total amount of time you have ever existed. If I am 40, then a week is only 0.05% of my total lifespan. Said another way, waiting 10 weeks feels the same to me as waiting a week does for you, the four-year-old. And plus I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for a video game and not a toy!\nAll the math is meant to confuse you into thinking I\u0026rsquo;m right. Certainly you can\u0026rsquo;t argue that the equations don\u0026rsquo;t lie. What was left unsaid is the basic hypothesis here: we measure the size of periods of time in relation to our own total experience of time. As we gain familiarity with time\u0026rsquo;s flow, that is, as we age, we can let more of it trickle by in one gulp without thinking too much about it. But I feel it\u0026rsquo;s more precise than that: our sense of how long a month or a year is is proportional to our age. That means that a one-day-old baby (awww) feels as much time go by in its second day of life as I will between now and when I\u0026rsquo;m 50. Wow. And to think mommy gets most of that day alone with baby in the hospital. I\u0026rsquo;m jealous.\n","date":917583113,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":917583113,"objectID":"3edbea257fa51fa18976b9ebf4a4f918","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/1999-01-29-aging/","publishdate":"1999-01-29T04:11:53Z","relpermalink":"/posts/1999-01-29-aging/","section":"posts","summary":"\nNote, this was written before I had a blog.

I recovered it from the Internet Archive. Back in graduate school I had a \u0026ldquo;musings\u0026rdquo; section of my site and those essays are in the same spirit as this blog so I\u0026rsquo;ve added them with retroactive datestamps.\nI recently saw the movie Titanic, directed by James Cameron. It provoked thoughts of many kinds, and I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure why. Part of it had to do with the moviemaking itself, which I\u0026rsquo;ll get to last. But part of it had to do with the story, as it was told, and the problem of negativity in our society.\nAs many people will tell you, Titanic can be broken down as follows: an hour and a quarter of plot to get you involved, followed by two hours of sinking. The first part was very enjoyable. Basically, if you remember Romeo and Juliet, then you get the idea. Upper-class girl (17 years old! practically statutory rape) meets lower-class boy during suicide attempt off back of ship, where lower-class members of society hang out. Desperate for personal attention and true human interaction, she falls madly in love with him. He draws a picture of her naked, they become the first to do it in the back of a car, then the ship sinks and he dies.\nAnyway, during the actual sinking, our young couple no longer form the focus of the movie. Instead, we are shown, in a style of moviemaking deliberately intended to smack of realism and documentary, how 2200 people from different segments of society would react to a crisis of this magnitude, as they scramble to get aboard enough lifeboats to save 1100 of them (but which end up only filled with 700). As Cameron (who also wrote the screenplay) shows us personal failure after personal failure, I found myself clicking my tongue along with it saying \u0026ldquo;Christ, what an ass,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe that guy did that,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Yep. That\u0026rsquo;s how people would react all right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not true.\nCameron shows too many negative moments, and almost no positive ones. I believe that there was just as much generosity and heroism to be found during this hell as there was animal behavior. Yes, people probably did keep others out of their lifeboat with an oar. Yes, the crew probably did tend to buckle under the pressure, but is there evidence that one of them started shooting people? (Of course, then that crew member blows his own head off in a grisley scene meant purely to shock. Shame on James.) Were there only cowardly men like the one that snuck onto a boat, praying he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be noticed, or were there also men who would have gladly sacrificed their place for another?\nCameron did provide counterpoint to these regrettable acts. He shows tender moments of parting between loved ones. And more parting between loved ones. And more. But no acts of bravery, no acts of self-sacrifice, no true human spirit coming through. The conclusion: James Cameron thinks there are no such people, except the fictional ones like Jack Dawson (our hero) who reside in a special world carved out for those who love like only fictional characters can do. No less than Romeo himself (no coincidence that whats-his-name was also in the recent MTV-videoesque version of Romeo and Juliet) could give of himself to save the life of a loved one. Bullshit. Lots of that was going on, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. Why aren\u0026rsquo;t we being shown those stories too? Not just the brave goodbyes, but the ones who stopped to help a panicked woman get on her boat, the ones that offered solace and hope when there really was none, the women that chose to stay with their loved ones instead of being rescued. (Incidentally, wasn\u0026rsquo;t that Irish woman (from Terminator 2) with her two kids both on a lifeboat and in her cabin when it finally sank?)\nWhy was the movie made that way? Why is it so negative? I am not sure, but I bet it has to do with making as much money from the movie as possible. That was obviously their motivation for doing every single thing they did. James Cameron is famously obsessive as a moviemaker. But take a look at his movies: they are pure candy. No grand themes, no elevating stories, no lovable characters. Just two-dimensional everything. Grab-your-attention, edge-of-your-seet, nonstop action. But in the process, he manages to beat every last shred of humanity from the story. The only reason for showing tenderness or real compassion is to set us up for the big disappointment when whoever it was gets blown away, or drowns, or freezes to death with her frozen baby in her arms (especially inappropriate, I thought).\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem such a great idea to use base ideas such as these to make a movie. It tends to make us unhappy, and who needs that? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go see someone tell me that people suck, that we\u0026rsquo;re a bunch of bastards, to show me how he thinks I\u0026rsquo;d react when placed on a sinking ship. Cameron has lowered our expectations of ourselves, and yet the movie will sell very well. We are used to seeing ourselves lowered in this way: take a look at the local news, or take a look at the way we act towards strangers, or take a look at how no one seems to stop bringing up the Holocaust, or even worse, bringing up the fact that that\u0026rsquo;s nothing compared to the number of Russians killed. \u0026ldquo;But if we forget about it, we\u0026rsquo;re doomed to repeat it one day,\u0026rdquo; they say. Exactly my point. Nice positive outlook on humanity, isn\u0026rsquo;t it. It\u0026rsquo;s not hip to be down on people, it\u0026rsquo;s the most negative possible activity.\nAs for my opinions on the moviemaking itself (from a technical standpoint), something really jumped out at me as I made my way home on the subway. As you may know, computer animation was extensively used in this movie. How else could there be complete fly-bys of a beautiful model of the Titanic, complete with actors moving about on deck? A flyover by a nonexistent camera over a ship that sunk 84 years ago with people that were never there walking around on it. This concept is so striking that there were, by my count, at least 10 of these scenes in the movie.\nThe point is clear: with the aid of computer technology, absolutely anything you could possibly imagine can be convincingly placed on film. Did you see Mouse Hunt? You actually felt like you were the mouse running around in the nooks and crannies of the house, something that would have been impossible with a real camera (or a real house, for that matter). Or Star Wars: Special Edition. George Lucas even says in an interview that things that were impossible in 1980 were doable now, even easy (I added the easy part).\nComputer animation is not easy, but it is straightforward. Interfaces for 3D software is constantly growing more sophisticated. And this same software (Infini-D, Strata Studio, Ray Dream Studio, 3D Studio Max, Lightwave, SoftImage, etc.) is getting cheaper. You can get your hands on powerful 3D software for doing simple animations for $100.\nWait a minute. Say that again? You mean millions of people have access to software only mildly crippled compared to what they made Titanic with? That\u0026rsquo;s right. And just think how much cheaper and better this software will be in a few years. It\u0026rsquo;s inevitable in the computer industry that price will drop while ease of use and power will increase.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when it hit me.\nI imagined a software program so easy to use that in a matter of moments I could have a 3D animation of exactly the idea in my head. Or a dream I had. Or something I saw. I could wake up, say \u0026ldquo;What a nightmare,\u0026rdquo; and show my wife exactly what the dream was. I could immediately show the person I was talking to the geometric shape I was studying. I would no longer have to wave my arms saying \u0026ldquo;big purple blobby thing with whiskers sort of and spots around the outside with a lever coming out crosswise from the center.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m having a hard time explaining here is that we might one day have a vehicle for showing exactly what\u0026rsquo;s in our minds, in 3 dimensions (4, including the potential for animation), instantly. What will this do to moviemaking?\nRegardless of whether I end up being able to show everyone my purple monster, sooner or later the folks that make movies will get fed up using their new power to just make things that look real. Enough dinosaurs, Godzillas, apes, mice, Titanics, explosions, space ships, and shields that come out of nowhere to encase a hero in metal. They\u0026rsquo;ll get more abstract. More creative. They\u0026rsquo;ll be able to express more subtle ideas than mere realism. They\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use the new medium like artists have been doing for millenia: they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to speak directly to our emotions.\nI just hope it happens after James Cameron retires.\n","date":892835012,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":892835012,"objectID":"818705da53268dfc81687086914379b2","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/1998-04-17-titanic/","publishdate":"1998-04-17T17:43:32Z","relpermalink":"/posts/1998-04-17-titanic/","section":"posts","summary":"\nNote, this was written before I had a blog.

I recovered it from the Internet Archive. Back in graduate school I had a “musings” section of my site and those essays are in the same spirit as this blog so I’ve added them with retroactive datestamps.\nI really feel that our society cannot sustain the \u0026ldquo;computer geek\u0026rdquo; model for very much longer.\nOf course, I\u0026rsquo;ll now have to describe what I mean by that model. It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed, but probably never given much thought to. It\u0026rsquo;s bound to be the case that there are people who are more expert at any given job than others, and not long ago computers were hard for anyone to use, even experts. Therefore it\u0026rsquo;s not surprise that there are adults (but mainly kids) out there who are better than most at using computers.\nHowever, I feel this edge will soften really soon, and perhaps disappear entirely.\nI think some examples are in order. I work in a math department, and for years mathematicians have been into their email. That\u0026rsquo;s simply because mathematics is so specialized that the likelihood that all your favorite colleagues in your area teach at your school is nil. So, you need fast, cheap channells of communication open all the time, and email fits the bill ideally. At around the same time email was getting hot in math, so was TeX. TeX is a document typesetting system which allows us math folks to typeset our own papers and equations with completely professional appearance. It requires a fair bit of computing power, and it\u0026rsquo;s so esoteric that at first it was only to be found on UNIX workstations. (The sad pathetic story of UNIX, which sucks, will be the topic of at least one other essay at some point, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. What a joke.) So that\u0026rsquo;s two reasons to have UNIX around a math department. Running an FTP server to distribute your papers, which are now completely electronically-based is a third, and for some the computational power of C programs is a fourth. In more recent days, web surfing is a must, and so is a web server. If students can\u0026rsquo;t get their homework and solutions and grades online these days (at least at Columbia), they start complaining (especially at Columbia, I bet).\nFine, so math departments have UNIX networks. Big deal. Well, you try running a UNIX system, even at home on your own PC or Mac, where you\u0026rsquo;re the only user. It\u0026rsquo;s hard. It\u0026rsquo;s hard mostly because UNIX sucks, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard nonetheless, and someone has to do it. It\u0026rsquo;s so hard, though, that to figure out how to do it is a full-time job! (Man, does UNIX suck.) So, each department needs at least one individual whose responsibliity is to keep the system up and working smoothly, including the individual programs running on it like email clients and servers, or web clients and web servers. As people break the system (because it sucks and is impossible to figure out) this person has to deal with the offenders and fix the problems. It\u0026rsquo;s really a social job, requiring the monitoring of a large group of independent people. Sometimes technical announcements have to be made (\u0026ldquo;From now on, please don\u0026rsquo;t lpr a .dvi file on lw421\u0026rdquo;). Sometimes this person gets mad. And here is my point: what if this administrator gets so mad that they stop doing their job. What if they quit? Well, the entire operation of the department would be put in jeopardy. No one would get their email. At first they would be mad. \u0026ldquo;Hey, why is the damn email broken? For christ\u0026rsquo;s sake, do something!\u0026rdquo; Then they\u0026rsquo;d realize that the only person who knows how to fix it is gone. \u0026ldquo;Crap, Peter left.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re powerless. They\u0026rsquo;d realize that they were entrusting a large and important element of their working life to one individual.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s too much power for one person.\nPeople need these technical programs working all the time. But they depend on one single individual person to do it. In some larger organizations, several people or a whole IS department may take care of it. But that means that those people can do something you can\u0026rsquo;t do yourself, even if you need it done now. It means that you have delegated responsibility for your machine and your email and your work to another. If it breaks, you can\u0026rsquo;t fix it, and they have to. People won\u0026rsquo;t stand for that kind of balance of power for very long. How many secretaries out there have figured out how to fix their copiers because they can\u0026rsquo;t stand how long it takes for the real copy dude to show up, let alone do a decent job?\nThe same principle applies here. I think people will gradually devote more of their time to learning how more complex computer operations are managed, such as networking and email. I think the software will get easier to use also, like it does in every other segment of the computer industry. The knowledge will decentralize. It won\u0026rsquo;t be a specialization anymore. Everyone will know how it works, just like people tend to know a little about how their car works, or how their washing machine works.\nNow, you may ask, what about plumbing? I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to fix my plumbing, and I use that all the time. In fact, I use it more than email (speak for yourself!). I don\u0026rsquo;t know how the insides of any of my home gadgets work, like my stereo, my TV, my phone, or even my computer.\nGood point. But computer software is somehow different, I think. So many people are using computer software these days, in so many incredibly complex ways, that something is very different about it. I think using software and email is like using the phone. It won\u0026rsquo;t be a big deal to restart your SMTP client or whatever, 5 years from now, because you just double-click this little icon, or select this menu entry. People are so comfortable with computers, that anyone who uses one today would be considered an expert four years ago. People know what GIFs are now, and how JPEGs can suck, so there\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff. They know about 8-bit versus 24-bit color depth. They know how big 800x600 pixels is. They know how to defragment their hard drives. They know how SCSI works, and that it\u0026rsquo;s faster than IDE. They know that an en-dash and an em-dash are different typographically. They know what \u0026hellip; means. They may even know what SGML stands for. Or the difference between a Postscript and a PDF file. These are extremely technical points, but some of us don\u0026rsquo;t see them that way anymore, because we literally work with them all the time. Computer technology is completely pervasive today, and will only get more so. Technical literacy is on the rise big time. And just in time for when your local guru gets fed up and quits. Maybe there won\u0026rsquo;t be IS departments in the future. Every working adult will know how to handle all that.\nThey will probably know from age six.\n","date":887010689,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":887010689,"objectID":"ea482687e960f63f9fa184331dc18fdd","permalink":"https://greg.langmead.info/posts/1998-02-09-computer-geeks/","publishdate":"1998-02-09T07:51:29Z","relpermalink":"/posts/1998-02-09-computer-geeks/","section":"posts","summary":"\nNote, this was written before I had a blog.
