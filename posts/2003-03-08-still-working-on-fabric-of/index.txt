Still working on Fabric of

Still working on Fabric of Reality, because I am a little lost in the chapter on quantum computing, which was the main topic I bought the book to read about. I’m sure I’ll figure it out eventually.
I’m just about finished re-listening to my audio-book version of The Fellowship of the Ring, which I enjoyed immensely. I’ve now read the dead-tree book once, and listened to this audio book twice.
