Now that I'm finished American

Now that I’m finished American Gods, I’m just reading The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch. It’s about physics, quantum computation, DNA, and lots of other topics, sort of unified into a really interesting and idiosyncratic world-view. David Deutsch is a father of quantum computing, so he knows what he’s talking about. I always prefer well-expressed personal viewpoints to bland, objective information.
