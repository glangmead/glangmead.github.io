So langmead.info seems relatively stable

So langmead.info seems relatively stable at the moment. As of now I have tried three hosting companies. This latest one strikes a good balance between price and features. They are having trouble installing PHPlib, which is needed for IMP, which is a web-based email client Alison wants. I might consider moving if they never get around to that (or upgrading to PHP 4.1, which would be just as good).
The idea here is that we have a home for family pictures, personal web sites (like this blog) and email. Mostly the last, because with mac.com going fee-based, and with the years passing and the number of email addresses I’ve used growing, it seems like a good time to have a permanent email address, and paying for the domain and the hosting puts it under my control, so it can remain as permanent as I want it to.
