Coming soon...

I’ll be adding my thoughts soon about three books by C. S. Lewis that I’ve recently finished. Although I had a few false starts with the Narnia books as a youth, these were read more to find out about the real Christian thinker, and because I wanted to branch out from Tolkien to some of his colleagues.
