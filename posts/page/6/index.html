    <h2><a href="/posts/2006-03-12-intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-3/">Intelligent Design: The Final Word, Part 3</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The central question I have been trying to satisfy myself about with these notes is the following: is there a way to formulate Intelligent Design as a scientific theory? (See part 1 and part 2.)

    <div class="article-style">
      
      This is a continuation of my discussion of ID (see part 1). Here in part 2 I have exerpted from Behe&rsquo;s book in order to summarize his argument. I am using the 2003 trade paperback edition published by Free Press, lent to me by a work colleague.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I am finally ready to write some definitive thoughts about Intelligent Design. I just finished reading Michael Behe&rsquo;s book Darwin&rsquo;s Black Box from 1996, and I&rsquo;ve thought about it from the perspective of science, falsifiability, religion, and philosophy. I would like to be very careful about where I plan and do not plan to take issue with him, so let me start in Part 1 by delineating the argument.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2005-12-10-written-verbal-tics/">Written verbal tics</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this down for a long time. There are two very widespread and very annoying idioms that I see a lot in amateur writing. The main example of the kind of writing I mean is product reviews on sites like Amazon, but I see it also on Macworld, CNet and other more professional sites.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I just watched Contact again for the first time in a while. A major theme of the movie is that the goals of science and religion are so hard to untangle that the two main protagonists have a very complicated adult relationship based on it.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2005-10-09-irrational-design/">Irrational Design?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      There is a great deal of controversy at the moment over Intelligent Design (ID) being taught in science classrooms. I have always felt very strongly about the dangers faced by science in our society, and this crisis is a perfect example of what can happen without careful vigilance on the part of science teachers and practitioners.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2005-06-16-mac-moments-2/">Mac Moments 2</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      My second Mac moment came when using the text editor TextWrangler to work on ShelfCentered.com. Yesterday I had put my Mac on mute for some reason, and of course I forgot about it and was working away this evening. I was searching a document for occurrences of a word, and there were none. Now, usually this would produce the usual audible beep. But the developers of TextWrangler included a feature that automatically detected my Mac was on mute, and instead popped a message up on the screen that said &ldquo;Not Found.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even really notice how wonderful this was until a minute later, because I just received the information and proceeded accordingly. I managed to capture the message before it faded out:

    <div class="article-style">
      
      At my workplace, the Mac platform is often derided by what I consider typical &ldquo;PC guys.&rdquo; These are technically savvy folks who for whatever reason feel very strongly that the Mac platform is poor, or should go away, or that Windows has definitively proven its superiority. Sometimes these same people are also very skeptical of Microsoft, but usually not. It&rsquo;s strange, though, that someone can feel so ambivalent about Microsoft yet so strongly negative about the Mac. Recently, the success of the iPod has served to greatly increase the bitterness and spite felt towards the Mac by such people.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2005-04-26-poker/">Poker</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;ve had poker on my mind since last Thanksgiving, specifically Texas Hold&rsquo;em. At this point, I have special hold&rsquo;em software, four poker strategy books and one nonfiction book about poker. I mostly study the books and play a bit with the software, but eventually I want to start a real-money account on one of the online poker sites. I feel that if I apply what&rsquo;s in the books, then I can win money, which would be a very fun goal to shoot for. Of course, to avoid having a gambling problem I have to tread very carefully and lower my expectations within reason for the early stages. I have been procrastinating setting up a new checking account for my poker money both because I truly hesitate to take this step, and because I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;m good enough yet.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2005-04-25-shelfcenteredcom/">ShelfCentered.com</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      For the last couple of months, I&rsquo;ve been working on a new side project that my wife, brother and sister and I came up with, called ShelfCentered.com. I haven&rsquo;t posted about ShelfCentered.com as of yet, because honestly I suspect it might be a good enough idea to really become something good, and I want to protect us from competitors! For example, there are a couple of shareware programs out there already that do what we&rsquo;re planning, and they&rsquo;ve created some limited buzz, but so far no one has thought to put the idea online in a nice web site. I won&rsquo;t go into detail just yet, but it&rsquo;s hard to maintain a blog without mentioning the thing that&rsquo;s my primary occupation outside work!
