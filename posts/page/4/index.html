      I&rsquo;ll be adding my thoughts soon about three books by C. S. Lewis that I&rsquo;ve recently finished. Although I had a few false starts with the Narnia books as a youth, these were read more to find out about the real Christian thinker, and because I wanted to branch out from Tolkien to some of his colleagues.

      I&rsquo;ve been writing a pretty major piece of Mac software for almost two and a half years. As I&rsquo;ve gone along, I&rsquo;ve run up against the shortcomings not only of the developer resources, but of course also in OS X itself, since developers are also users.

Anyway, I&rsquo;m in bed, which means Penelope is in the chair and Alison&rsquo;s got her arms all over my pillows.

Yesterday was my 30th birthday. Alison threw me a surprise party (just the two of us) on Friday night and made me a bunny cake! Yesterday she gave me a bottle of really nice tequila, and I had some with breakfast ;-). My brother got me a book, and there are more gifts on the way that I don&rsquo;t know what they are. Alison and I had a nice visit to our favorite boba tea place in Long Beach, then headed over to Anaheim to see the Angels play the Mariners, and I got a proper Angels hat. It&rsquo;s made of really light, breathable material and it was very comfortable. It also represents some sort of turning point for me, as I do not change baseball allegience lightly, though eventually I guess I always do.

      Now that I&rsquo;m finished American Gods, I&rsquo;m just reading The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch. It&rsquo;s about physics, quantum computation, DNA, and lots of other topics, sort of unified into a really interesting and idiosyncratic world-view. David Deutsch is a father of quantum computing, so he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. I always prefer well-expressed personal viewpoints to bland, objective information.

      I just finished reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman. I enjoyed it, but it was a little slow. Basically it explores the idea (in fictional form) that gods from the various pantheons traveled to America with the settlers and started trying to eke their living here. In this day and age, it&rsquo;s not easy to be a god, and they&rsquo;re almost like pathetic people.

      So langmead.info seems relatively stable at the moment. As of now I have tried three hosting companies. This latest one strikes a good balance between price and features. They are having trouble installing PHPlib, which is needed for IMP, which is a web-based email client Alison wants. I might consider moving if they never get around to that (or upgrading to PHP 4.1, which would be just as good).
