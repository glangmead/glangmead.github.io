    <div class="article-style">
      
      Microsoft Excel was released in 1985 for the Mac and in 1987 for Windows. Today I was using the 2007 version. After 20 years of work by countless engineers, it cannot open two files with the same name, and the dialog is quite shameless about it. That&rsquo;s a good word: &ldquo;shameless.&rdquo; Details are everything. Click to see the full size.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      As you know, I want to stream movies and music from my PC to my TV. I have an all-star lineup of tools:
* PC running Vista with Windows Media Player 11 (WMP11), iTunes, and Zune software * Xbox 360 * PlayStation 3 * TiVo * Airport Express And a selection of Xvid, Divx, MPEG 4, MP3, and AAC files to stream. These are all extremely widely used formats, the most popular in their categories (the first three are video, the last two are audio). All the players I mentioned play these formats, at least after installing some popular codec packs.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Robert X. Cringely, my favorite tech pundit, had an interesting aside in this week&rsquo;s column (which is otherwise about Apple and Blu-Ray). He ran across a use of the term &lsquo;bug&rsquo; to mean a glitch in a technical system in a magazine article from the 1930s. I found this fascinating, since we always assume &ldquo;we&rdquo; invented the term when computers came along. He closes with this:

    <h2><a href="/posts/2007-12-30-panzer-tactics/">Panzer Tactics</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Over this holiday break, I played through all the tutorials in one of my newer DS games Panzer Tactics. It&rsquo;s a very engrossing turn-based war game, very much along the lines of Advance Wars. Panzer Tactics clicked much more with me, though, and I grasped how to deploy my units intuitively pretty quickly. I think I can take this experience back to Advance Wars as well, and have more fun with it, too. But first, I&rsquo;m ready to start the real campaigns in Panzer Tactics. Then maybe I&rsquo;ll go back to Korsun Pocket, which is more complicated.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Over Thanksgiving, I was complaining about people who crowd forward when boarding a plane, even if their row hasn&rsquo;t been called, so that when it is called, they get on first. And if they can get away with boarding before their row is called, they&rsquo;ll do that too. Someone close to me retorted, &ldquo;competition made the human race what it is today.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t stopped thinking about that remark ever since. Can this person be right? I dearly, dearly hope not. Because all I can think of in reply is, &ldquo;yes, it did make us what we are &ndash; especially the World Wars and the Holocaust.&rdquo;

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;m listening to The Return of the King: The Complete Recordings at work, and I&rsquo;m at the point near the (first) end when Frodo and Sam have just destroyed the ring (with Gollum&rsquo;s unwitting help) and they&rsquo;re escaping the flowing lava by standing on a rock, feeling a relieved. With all the events of the story to back up the scene, I think it&rsquo;s truly moving to see these two regular guys, who together destroyed a great and senseless evil power. I actually see it as a very tragic moment, when two of the world&rsquo;s great forces are being presented to us via the heightened drama of this point in the story: senseless evil/destruction/chaos on the one hand, and the fortitude and perseverance and good of the common person on the other hand. You can ask all sorts of questions at this point, like if the common person is so good, where is all the evil coming from? Why must the most ordinary and good people sustain such injury and sacrifice to ward off the worst effects of the evil?

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Has Masterpiece Theater always just been some British TV show? Lately they&rsquo;ve been showing The Amazing Mrs. Prithcard, which felt like an American TV show that happened to be British. Is it a masterpiece? Did they pick it because they felt it was a masterpiece? Maybe they should rename Masterpiece Theater to &ldquo;Some British TV Show&rdquo;.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The Zune software turned out not to be so great at working with iTunes playlists. It&rsquo;s not a dynamic synchronization, just a one-time thing. So after asking the Zune to read my iTunes playlists, it did so, but after I changed my playlists in iTunes, the Zune did not see the change. Also, the Zune does not attempt to pull in the smart playlists, just the static ones. Even just treating the smart playlists as regular ones and pulling in their current contents would have been great, but no.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Microsoft includes a Windows-based desktop media player with their Zune portable media players, to manage your music and sync it with the Zune. It&rsquo;s a lot like Windows Media Player, which I despise, but actually if you own an Xbox 360 there are two reasons to install the Zune software even if you don&rsquo;t own a Zune:
