      I need new music. For years I&rsquo;ve been listening to a core group of bands: XTC, Beatles, Squeeze, Joe Jackson, various solo Beatles, R.E.M., Billy Joel and They Might Be Giants, with smaller amounts of the B-52&rsquo;s, Indigo Girls, and a little Classical (mostly Mozart, Bach and Beethoven of course).

      I recently rented The Lord of the Rings in audiobook format, on CD, from Recorded Books. They make, sell, and rent audiobooks. When you rent, they send you the books in a box-within-a-box. The inner box is for sending it back, so there is very little hassle.

      So the Paint-by-Numbers project, named Go-Gan, is proceeding. Absolutely no interface has been coded yet, just the representation of the underlying puzzle. Tonight I&rsquo;ll write the logic that creates the list of clues from a row or column of painted cells.

      I&rsquo;m going to get started today on a new piece of software. It will be a multipurpose &ldquo;Paint by Numbers&rdquo; application. Paint by Numbers is a puzzle game (I am not yet sure whether this name is a trademark or not) where you are presented with a blank rectangular grid of squares, usually about 20x20 or larger (the bigger it is, the harder it is). The goal is to reproduce the picture by deducing which squares should be colored. The clues are lists of numbers, one list for each row and one list for each column. Each number in the list is the tally for a consecutive run of colored squares. Visit this Japanese site for some examples to try.

      —
      I was thinking about Close Encounters of the Third Kind the other day. I was pretty young, so take this with a grain of salt, but here&rsquo;s what I was thinking. At the beginning, a mood of chaos is set when as-yet-unintroduced high-ranking officials meet in a remote location where a World War II plane (boat?) has been found. They arrive in a helicopter, and part of the fun and tension of the scene is the landing of this loud helicopter. It really is exciting, because, you know, you don&rsquo;t see helicopters land every day. These guys must really be important, and there must be quite a bit of urgency!

      There is a lot of buzz about a book called The Cluetrain Manifesto. I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s about dotcoms, or about social forces in the Internet Age. But, they provided the whole book online, so I ciphoned it onto my Palm and I&rsquo;m going to read it. I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.

      Alison came up with an interesting quote in her dissertation research on 12th century France:
As I hear more and more about this time period from Alison, I see why she studies history. It sheds light forward onto our own time. Would you describe our current ways of thinking as &ldquo;eschewing univocal interpretations,&rdquo; because I wouldn&rsquo;t. I forget who said the following but I agree and I guess so would the scholars of 1100: the older I get, the more I learn that not only is it okay to hold contradictory beliefs, but the deepest, most important elements of life are bound up in such opposing truths.

      I was really looking forward to the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics tonight, but over the last few days I&rsquo;ve been growing increasingly uneasy about what I might see there. As it turned out, after the initial voice-overs by Messrs. McKay (co-alum of my high school!) and Costas, I turned off the television. I&rsquo;m only going to tune in when events I want to see are on.

      I HAVE AN E-BOOK OBSESSION! Did you know that? Let me explain.
E-book is obviously short for electronic book. This sounds like a nineteenth century name for what it is: a computer file. In such a computer file are the contents of a book. For example, a Word document with Pride and Prejudice in it is an e-book. So is a plain text file of the same book, or a web page or any other format. The point is that the environment where the book is read is a digital computer environment. There are a few issues about e-books that I think are important. First, there is the issue of reading an entire book on a screen. Despite that, I am obsessed with reading e-books, so I will explain why. Finally, what does the future hold for e-books?
