    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;m going way out on a limb here, so bear with me.
42% of Americans are pro-choice, according to a new Gallup poll, and 51% are pro-life. My response to this is: since so many Americans disagree with the pro-life stance, then we should stick with the neutral road, which is the policy to keep abortions legal.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2009-02-24-nudge/">Nudge</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;m reading an interesting book about economics, public policy, and psychology. It&rsquo;s called Nudge. They make many interesting points that were completely new to me about the way people do not behave in the rational manner modeled by the previous generation of economists. In fact, there are systematic biases in our decision-making that can be quantified and worked around by enacting sensible policies. The cover issues ranging from the Medicare prescription drug plan to 401k plans, to organ donation, to the environment. The ideas are presented clearly with lots of examples. Highly recommended.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2009-01-12-vista-ick/">Vista = Ick</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;m so tired of living with Windows Vista. Especially when it comes to USB. Whenever I plug in a USB device that I&rsquo;ve used a million times before, but I plug it into a different USB port, Vista goes into overdrive. &ldquo;Searching for driver!&rdquo; it exclaims in a balloon. The hard drive churns and churns for about two minutes. You can&rsquo;t do anything else disk-intensive during this time, so basically you&rsquo;re just waiting at this point. If you click the little tray icon that appears, it says &ldquo;Searching for driver in installed locations&rdquo; or something. Finally it&rsquo;s done and it says &ldquo;Canon digital camera.&rdquo; No kidding, the one I plugged in yesterday? Congratulations. Maybe I should plug it into each port in my hub so that I can go through this once and then know that I&rsquo;m safe.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2008-10-08-freshness/">Freshness</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I love the feeling I get after I tweak what songs are on my iPhone. I added a composer (Mahler) and a Teaching Company course (about Mahler) because I finished listening to another course (about US relations with the Middle East). I added some Beatles album art and the latest Ben Folds album. It&rsquo;s all freshened up and ready for new listening!

    <h2><a href="/posts/2008-08-17-infocom-games-using-your-voice/">Infocom games, using your voice</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I have a long history with Infocom games (&ldquo;text adventures&rdquo; was what I called them as a kid, and &ldquo;interactive fiction&rdquo; is the new name). People still write these games, did you know that? There&rsquo;s a big archive and an annual competition. I haven&rsquo;t played any of the non-Infocom variety, though I think I ought to try one. I have copies of all the data files for all the original Infocom games from the 80s, and for years there has been an open-source program to load these files and let you play the games. It&rsquo;s called Frotz. I&rsquo;ve had a version of Frotz on all my computers for the last 12 years, including my various Palm PDAs. The only Infocom game I&rsquo;ve ever finished in my life (making it one of like 5 games of any variety that I have ever finished) was &ldquo;Enchanter&rdquo;, which I played on the Palm. The latest incarnation of Frotz is for the iPhone, and so of course I downloaded it right away.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2008-07-23-phasing-out-music-progress-bars/">Phasing out music progress bars?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The iPhone does not display any progress bar or countdown to let you know when the song you&rsquo;re listening to will end. If you tap the screen, such a bar is temporarily displayed, but it isn&rsquo;t there all the time. On the classic iPod, in iTunes, and in most other software-based music players, we&rsquo;ve been getting used to having these indicators. I don&rsquo;t like them because I think a song should set its own pace. I think it detracts from the listening experience to see there are 30 seconds left, because when I see that, I start thinking about how short a time that is, and will the rest of the song really fit because they have a whole other chorus to sing, etc.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2008-07-20-iphone-versus-clie/">iPhone versus Clie</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
       I&rsquo;ve owned a Palm or Clie device (which used the Palm OS) for 8 years. I used them as my PIM and as an eBook reader. My very first blog post was about eBooks, back in 2001. But my needs for a calendar are slim (but not zero), and my need for contact information is confined to making phone calls, which my devices couldn&rsquo;t do, or sending Christmas cards, when I&rsquo;m at home. So eventually my latest Clie, the TH-55, sat on my bedside table as my bedtime eBook reader.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2008-07-16-the-ipod-becomes-software/">The iPod becomes software</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
       I bought an iPhone 3G this past weekend (and waited 4 1/2 hours for the privilege). One of its functions is to play your music/movies like an iPod. You access this feature through a button labeled &ldquo;iPod&rdquo;. It has a picture of an old, non-iPhone iPod on it. This struck me as funny (haha funny). I think of the iPhone as subsuming the iPod in a device with extra functionality. But to explain to the user what this button does, it has a picture of an old iPod on it. And it&rsquo;s not called &ldquo;iTunes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Music and Movies&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Media&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;iPod&rdquo;. So the iPod has become a piece of software, and the hardware has just become an icon.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2008-07-10-on-the-importance-of-mentors/">On the importance of mentors</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I grew up assuming that people make their own way in the world. I thought it was up to me to make every decision, plan every move, open every door, and find my own way in my life and career. Only much later did I learn that I was doing it all wrong. Not only is my way much harder, it&rsquo;s also completely miserable to be so isolated. Here&rsquo;s an example. The place where I started making these wrong decisions was in college. I attended my classes, which in some cases were way below my capabilities, and in other cases were way above. Either way, at the end of class, I packed up my things and walked back to my room. I dreamed of being a scientist, just like I had since I was 10 years old. But all I did was go to class, I never spoke with any professors, nor was I ever approached by any. My talents started to appear in my sophomore year, but I was still doing things in this retarded way. Then in my junior year the first consequence of my nihilistic lifestyle happened, and I didn&rsquo;t even really notice it for what it was until years later. I switched my major from Astronomy to Astrophysics, then I added a concentration (minor) in Math, and then I made Math a second major. This all happened within a couple of months. Even these bureaucratic thrashings didn&rsquo;t raise any red flags in any administrators or professors. No one cared. So, I shifted my focus to math, threw away the pile of physics grad school applications I had, and requested a bunch of math ones. I went to graduate school for a year at Stony Brook, then transferred back to Columbia for the rest of my Ph.D., because my then-girlfriend, now-wife, was continuing on from Columbia undergrad to grad school.
