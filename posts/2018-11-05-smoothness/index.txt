Smoothness

This post accompanies a pair of talks given at CMU in November 2018.
Coming soon: my notes from the talk, and possibly a screencast.

Wikipedia article about differential structures, with a table of counts of exotic spheres. The Wild World of Four-manifolds by Alexandru Scorpan (2005), a simply wonderful resource about smooth structures in all dimensions, as a matter of fact. A post that helped me with a proof about the ring of smooth functions determining a manifold. A book that looks wonderful (Natural Operations in Differential Geometry by Kolar, Michor and Slovak, 1993), but which I’ve had to pilfer rudely for information about the fully faithful embedding of smooth manifolds inside the category of commutative algebras.
