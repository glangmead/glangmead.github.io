      <p>I have a long history with Infocom games (&ldquo;text adventures&rdquo; was what I called them as a kid, and &ldquo;interactive fiction&rdquo; is the new name). People still write these games, did you know that? There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/">big archive</a> and an <a href="http://ifcomp.org/">annual competition</a>. I haven&rsquo;t played any of the non-Infocom variety, though I think I ought to try one. I have copies of all the data files for all the original Infocom games from the 80s, and for years there has been an open-source program to load these files and let you play the games. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://frotz.sourceforge.net/">Frotz</a>. I&rsquo;ve had a version of Frotz on all my computers for the last 12 years, including my various Palm PDAs. The only Infocom game I&rsquo;ve ever finished in my life (making it one of like 5 games of any variety that I have ever finished) was &ldquo;Enchanter&rdquo;, which I played on the Palm. The <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287653015&amp;mt=8">latest incarnation of Frotz</a> is for the iPhone, and so of course I downloaded it right away.</p>
<p>PDAs in general are not the easiest devices to type on, though, and there&rsquo;s lots of typing in Infocom games. So it occurred to me that it would be really cool to speak the commands. After all, there is a limited vocabulary, which should be ideal for getting good accuracy from automatic speech recognition, and furthermore the engine should require a pretty small amount of data. On top of that, what if Frotz synthesized a (pleasant, configurable) computer voice to read you all the text in the game? Then you could set the iPhone down in front of you, close your eyes, and enjoy a nice bit of interactive fiction by having a dialog with thin air. All of a sudden the very stodgiest and oldest of technology leapfrogs three decades of competition and actually sounds futuristic! I patted myself on the back for thinking of such a great idea, and told myself I&rsquo;d take a stab at it myself &ldquo;one day,&rdquo; since speech recognition is just a hop, skip and a jump away from machine translation.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all, there&rsquo;s a punchline to this story. It further occurred to me that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been the first to think of this idea, so I did a Google search. <a href="http://iphonefrotz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/SPEECH">The link I found</a> is inside a code repository for Frotz itself, namely the iPhone version. Actually, this is just a branch of Frotz, so I checked the general Frotz SourceForge repository as well and the same file is there too. It&rsquo;s a placeholder for future work on just this idea, but it&rsquo;s super-vague and kind of creepy, what with the whole &ldquo;commissioned by a presently undisclosed party&rdquo; thing. The technology looks good, it&rsquo;s all open-source stuff released by academics, which was where I figured I would start looking as well.</p>
<p>So who wrote this document, and when, and when do they intend to come out of the shadows with the result of their work? Who knows &ndash; but it sure is a weird end to my story.</p>
