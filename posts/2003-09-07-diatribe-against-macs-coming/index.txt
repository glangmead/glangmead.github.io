Diatribe against Macs coming

I’ve been writing a pretty major piece of Mac software for almost two and a half years. As I’ve gone along, I’ve run up against the shortcomings not only of the developer resources, but of course also in OS X itself, since developers are also users.
At this point, I’m essentially ready to abandon the Mac for greener pastures elsewhere, but I have to work it out a bit first, so I’m going to be posting a multi-section reflection on the matter. I am extremely hesitant to change my attitude from “mac-zealot” to “mac-doubter,” and that’s definitely one of the issues going on here. The Mac demands defensiveness from its adherents, and so I meet much resistance from my own history and contrary nature when I consider embracing my disgust.
Much, much more coming soon.
