I just finished reading American

I just finished reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman. I enjoyed it, but it was a little slow. Basically it explores the idea (in fictional form) that gods from the various pantheons traveled to America with the settlers and started trying to eke their living here. In this day and age, it’s not easy to be a god, and they’re almost like pathetic people.
