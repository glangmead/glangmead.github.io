      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Mathematicians have been exploring the advantages of locale theory for
60 or so years, along with its related disciplines of topos theory and
type theory. When you tie one hand behind your back (such as avoiding
the use of the existence of points, the axiom of choice, and/or the law
of the excluded middle) then the constructions and proofs you invent can
be more illuminating and deeper than before. I want to convince you that
this may be true for algorithmic randomness notions. In [@simpson], Alex
Simpson has formulated a measure theory for locales and provided a new
definition of randomness in this setting. I will describe this work,
emphasizing the <em>point-free</em> interpretation.</p>
<p>Random real numbers satisfy the following hand-waving characterizations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They cannot be obtained constructively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They obey almost-everywhere properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They appear tied to the foundations of mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a survey of these and other properties, see Rute [@rute]. I will
argue that defining random points in terms of locales is well suited to
capturing or even explaining all three of these properties. First of
all, locales provide a setting for topology that supports constructive
arguments, and randomness is in some sense the opposite of
constructivity. Secondly, locales provide a model of topological spaces
and continuous functions, so we can connect with classical results in
analysis including almost-everywhere theorems like Lebesgue&rsquo;s theorem.
And thirdly locales mediate a generalization from set theory to topos
theory and type theory, modern constructive settings where mathematical
foundations are being explored. Constructions like the effective topos
and assemblies capture computability in this general context. It seems
inevitable that randomness will find enhanced definitions in these new
foundations.</p>
<h2 id="randomness-vs-determinism-a-confused-debate">Randomness vs determinism: a confused debate</h2>
<p>In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&rsquo;s article on Chance and
Randomness [@sep-chance-randomness], section 5.2 (&quot;Chaotic Dynamics&quot;),
the authors describe an iterated transformation on the unit square,
somewhat analogous to repeatedly folding dough. Given a starting point
$(p,q), 0\leq p, q\leq 1$, define a function $$\phi(p,q) =
\begin{cases}
(2p, q/2), &amp; \text{if } 0 \le p \le \frac{1}{2} \
(2p-1,(1+q)/2), &amp; \text{if } \frac{1}{2} \le p \le 1
\end{cases}$$ As the authors say, &ldquo;This corresponds to transforming the
unit square to a rectangle twice as wide and half the height, chopping
off the right half, and stacking it back on top to fill the unit square
again.&rdquo; So, needlessly more violent than folding, but close. If we
represent $p$ and $q$ in their binary expansion, we have
$$\phi (0.p_1 p_2\ldots, 0.q_1 q_2\ldots) = (0.p_2 p_3\ldots , 0.p_1 q_1 q_2\ldots).$$
In the article this example is intended to convey a paradox. On the one
hand, the system is ergodic and behaves like a random process. Points
will wander throughout the space without any pattern. But on the other
hand the system is deterministic. The bit shift formula shows how it
works: this is an engine that uses the next bit of the binary expansion
to determine where the point moves next.</p>
<p>The resolution of the paradox, I believe, is to worry more about whether
you can get your hands on $p$ and $q$ in the first place. Sure, once you
have them, the machine behaves deterministically. But you can&rsquo;t have
them! They require an infinite amount of information to specify, and to
have one is to provide its entire future path through the process. The
problem with the paradox is therefore in one of its assumptions. The
process is deterministic, but the randomness is in the input data.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most important property of random numbers appears to be
their infinite nature, which prevents us from ever having one fully
specified for us, either in a machine, in our minds, or in our theories.
They are not computable, and they are not constructible.</p>
<p>Confusingly, there are several different definitions of algorithmic
randomness. In fact there is a whole family (or if you&rsquo;re in a teasing
mood, a zoo) of them. They go by names such as Martin-Löf randomness,
Schnorr randomness, weak-$n$-randomness, and computable randomness. They
are not equivalent but they form a simple chain of inclusions, and smart
people have worked out that the differences can be explained and
parameterized by a family of choices that relate them. What I will
present here is a consideration that is orthogonal to the flavor of
randomness, namely the <em>packaging</em> of the random numbers inside the
reals. The main ingredient is a shift from <em>set theory</em> to <em>locale
theory</em>. A locale is a generalization of a topological space, and I will
argue that it is very well suited to a philosophical interpretation of
randomness.</p>
<h1 id="frames-and-locales">Frames and Locales</h1>
<p>Locale theory is point-free topology. See Johnstone [@johnstone1983] for
an accessible survey, or Chapter IX of Mac Lane and Moerdijk [@maclane]
for a pleasantly breezy but more thorough introduction, or Johnstone
[@sketches] chapter C1 for a detailed treatment. We can also call it
<em>synthetic</em> topology in that it takes open sets as basic, undefined
objects, instead of defining them as collections of points. Instead it
is points that will become a derived concept. Topological spaces with
their actual open sets of actual points provide examples of locales, but
there are more general ones as well. This will give us a new point of
view on randomness.</p>
<p>A locale is a <em>frame</em>. A frame is a partially ordered set (poset) with
finite meets $\wedge$ and arbitrary joins $\vee$, with a maximal element
$\top$ and minimal element $\ensuremath{\bot}$, and where the infinite
distributive law holds:
$$x \wedge (\bigvee_i y_i)=\bigvee_i (x\wedge y_i).$$ This definition is
clearly abstracted from the axioms for a topology: we are to imagine the
elements of the poset are open sets of a generalized space. If we
require only countable joins then it is called a $\sigma$-frame. The
open sets of a topological space form a frame (or a $\sigma$-frame). A
frame map is a function that preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins.
A $\sigma$-frame map preserves countable joins. We collect this data
into the category $\mathsf{Frm}$ of frames and $\mathsf{\sigma Frm}$ of
$\sigma$-frames.</p>
<p>A continuous map between topological spaces induces a frame map on the
frames of open sets, but in the opposite direction because the <em>inverse</em>
image of an open is open. This motivates the definition of the category
$\mathsf{Loc}$ of locales to be simply
$\ensuremath{\mathsf{Frm}}^{\textsf{op}}$ and
$\ensuremath{\mathsf{\sigma Loc}}=\ensuremath{\mathsf{\sigma Frm}}^{\textsf{op}}$.
(Recall that the opposite of a category is a category with all the same
objects and morphisms, but with the direction of all the morphism arrows
reversed.) We can define a functor
$L:\ensuremath{\mathsf{Top}}\to\ensuremath{\mathsf{Loc}}$ on objects by
mapping a space $X$ to its frame of open sets
$\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)$ (so on objects,
$L=\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}$), and on morphisms by mapping a function
$f:X\to Y$ to the opposite arrow of the induced morphism on frames, so
that&rsquo;s two inversions giving us an arrow $L(f):L(X)\to L(Y)$.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use notation like $X, Y, \ldots$ to denote locales, and
$\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X), \ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(Y), \ldots$ to
denote frames of open sets.</p>
<h1 id="points">Points</h1>
<p>Consider the topological space $\star$ consisting of a single point. Its
topology is just the poset ${\bot \leq \top}$ (the empty set and the
whole space). To treat points as a derived concept, note that a point in
a space $X$ is equivalent to a map $\mathrm{pt}:\star\to X$, which at
the level of frames is a map
$\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)\to{\top, \bot}$. The inverse image of
$\top$ is the collection of all open sets that contain the point
$\mathrm{pt}(\star)$. This forms what is known as a <em>completely prime
filter</em> in the frame, which is a collection $P$ of opens such that if
$x\vee y\in P$ then $x\in P$ or $y\in P$. (This is analogous to a prime
ideal, or the ideal generated by a prime number.) We can then move
forward with locales and completely prime filters instead of spaces and
points!</p>
<p>Note how compatible this is with a constructive point of view. To supply
a point you must supply a function $\star\to X$. The points aren&rsquo;t
given, you have to do work to produce one.</p>
<p>Given a locale $X$, the set of completely prime filters constitutes the
<em>spatial part</em> of $X$, and this set inherits a topology from the
structure of $X$. Locale maps preserve prime filters so we obtain a set
function between the spatial parts of the locales. We can package this
as a functor $S:\ensuremath{\mathsf{Loc}}\to\ensuremath{\mathsf{Top}}$
which turns out to be right adjoint to $L$. If we go back and forth with
$S\circ L$, starting from an honest topological space, then we get back
an equivalent space with an equivalent topology so long as the original
space is <em>sober</em>, which is a definition that is almost circularly
defined to meet this condition. Hausdorff spaces are sober. (The
mathematicians who developed locale theory were very self-conscious
about the names according to Peter Johnstone in [@johnstone2] and it
shows &mdash; they chose great names like &ldquo;sober.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t make use of $S$, but it&rsquo;s important to know about it to have a
global picture of how spaces are embedded in the larger category of
locales.</p>
<h1 id="sublocales">Sublocales</h1>
<p>Mathematicians have been careful to choose the correct notion of
subspace in this context: the sublocale. There are three equivalent ways
to define sublocales. Normally I&rsquo;d expect two since we are bouncing
between two opposite categories. But there is a super interesting third
definition as well, and the interplay of all three sheds light on the
application to randomness.</p>
<h2 id="definition-1-embedded-subspaces">Definition 1: Embedded subspaces</h2>
<p>To me the most intuitive definition is the one that lets us think of a
sublocale as being like an <em>embedded subspace</em>, i.e. a monomorphic map
with the extra requirement that the subspace is embedded. In the
category of topological spaces this means the domain is homeomorphic to
its image. For example, for a map from $[0,1]$ into a space $X$ to be an
embedding the curve must not self-intersect or do anything pathological.
In categorical terms embeddings and sublocales are <em>regular
monomorphisms</em> and these have special factorization properties. You can
maybe already tell that this is a less permissive notion of subspace
than subspaces in $\mathsf{Top}$, where any old subset of a topological
space (i.e. any monomorphism) can be equipped with the subspace topology
and considered a subobject.</p>
<h2 id="definition-2-quotients-of-frames">Definition 2: Quotients of frames</h2>
<p>In the category of frames the arrows are reversed and so a sublocale is
in fact a quotient frame, i.e. an equivalence relation. Intuitively, two
open sets are equivalent if they agree on the sublocale. Precisely, a
sublocale $=_Y$ is an equivalence relation that preserves finite meets
and arbitrary joins: $$\begin{aligned}
U=_Y V\mathrm{\ and\ }U&rsquo;=_Y V&rsquo;&amp;\quad\implies\quad U\wedge U&rsquo;=_Y V\wedge V&rsquo; \
U_i=<em>Y V_i\mathrm{\ for\ all\ } i\geq 0&amp;\quad\implies\quad \bigvee</em>{i\geq 0}U_i =<em>Y \bigvee</em>{i\geq 0} V_i.\end{aligned}$$</p>
<h2 id="definition-3-nuclei">Definition 3: Nuclei</h2>
<p>The nucleus definition of a sublocale also takes place in the category
of frames. It is just the surjective map corresponding to the quotient.
A nucleus is a function
$j:\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)\to\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)$ satisfying
$$\begin{aligned}
U&amp;\leq jU \
jjU &amp;= jU \
j(U\wedge V)&amp;=j(U)\wedge j(V)\end{aligned}$$ The intuition is that $j$
takes an open set to some largest version of itself satisfying some
property, which is why the first condition has the containment, and why
the second condition is idempotence &ndash; doing the operation twice yields
the same largest open. The third condition is that forming the &ldquo;largest
version&rdquo; preserves finite intersection.</p>
<p>Denote the fixed points of $j$ (i.e. the collection of largest sets) by
$\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}_j(X)$ and denote the dual object by $X_j$.
Then $X_j$ is the sublocale. The map $j$ is a surjective frame map onto
the set of fixed points, and so gives an embedding
$i:X_j\hookrightarrow X$. This is basically performing the quotient from
the previous definition, mapping every open onto the largest
representative in the equivalence class.</p>
<h2 id="the-collection-of-all-sublocales">The collection of all sublocales</h2>
<p>The collection of all sublocales of a fixed locale $X$ is partially
ordered by inclusion, just as we have in any category where we can
define subobjects. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that even more is true: the
collection of sublocales forms a <em>coframe</em>, which is duel to a frame, so
is a poset with finite joins and arbitrary meets, and where the joins
distribute over the meets. This collection is nowhere near as
straightforward to contemplate as the collection of subsets of a set,
but we will keep thinking through some of the consequences to find how
it connects with randomness.</p>
<h2 id="a-pointless-sublocale">A pointless sublocale</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re ready to define a sublocale with no points! Let $X$ be a Hausdorff
topological space without isolated points and let
$\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)$ be the frame of its open sets. Consider
the double-negation operation
$\neg\neg:\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)\to\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)$.
What does this do? The negation of an open $U$ is the largest open
disjoint from $U$ (or equivalently, the union of all opens disjoint from
$U$). In an actual space such as $X$ this is the same as the interior of
the complement, but in a locale we don&rsquo;t have complements since they are
not open. Repeating the operation, $\neg\neg U$ is thus the largest open
disjoint from the largest open disjoint from $U$. For a lot of sets this
is just $U$ again but sometimes it erases information. For any $p\in X$
we have that $\neg\neg(X-{p}) = X$, because
$\neg (X-{p})=\emptyset$. So this operation blurs out the points.</p>
<p>$\neg\neg$ is idempotent, and in fact defines a nucleus hence an
embedding $nn:X_{\neg\neg}\hookrightarrow X$, where
$nn^{-1}U=\neg\neg U$. It&rsquo;s this sublocale $X_{\neg\neg}$ that has no
points. For suppose $p:\star\to X_{\neg\neg}$ is a point. The
composition $nn\circ p$ is thus a point of $X$. Consider the open set
given by deleting this point from $X$, i.e. $X-{nn(p(\star))}$. Taking
the inverse image in frames we have
$p^{-1}(\neg\neg(X-{nn(p(\star))})) = \bot$ because only opens that
contain the image of $\star$ map back to $\top$. But as we saw in the
previous paragraph $\neg\neg(X-{nn(p(\star))}) = X$, so the above
expression $p^{-1}(\neg\neg(X-{nn(p(\star))})$ becomes $p^{-1}(X)$
which is $\top$, a contradiction! You can&rsquo;t have points if you blurred
away the points.</p>
<p>Furthermore, $X_{\neg\neg}$ is <em>dense</em> in $X$. For a sublocale
$A\hookrightarrow X$ to be dense means that $A$ intersects every open
sublocale. (An open sublocale is one of the original open sets in $X$,
promoted to a sublocale by embedding it in $X$.) This follows from being
a nucleus: $\neg\neg A \supseteq A$. The definitions are piling up,
aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<h2 id="locale-morphisms">Locale morphisms</h2>
<p>A fact that makes the category of locales different from the category of
spaces is that any two dense sublocales intersect to form another dense
sublocale! If we intersect all dense sublocales we form a <em>smallest
dense sublocale</em> of any locale $X$ and it turns out to be exactly
$X_{\neg\neg}$. By smallest I mean inside the poset of sublocales. None
of this is the case with topological spaces such as $\mathbb{R}$ which
can be decomposed into disjoint dense sub<em>sets</em> such as $\mathbb{Q}$ and
$\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$. This is confusing! What does the
sublocale $\mathbb{Q}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ look like then? The
consequences for measure theory are significant, since defining measures
on sets leads to some pathological examples involving cosets of the
rationals.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the <em>image</em> of a sublocale inclusion. For this we need the
&ldquo;push-forward&rdquo; map
$f_<em>:\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)\to\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(Y)$, which
is actually right adjoint to the inverse image map
$f^{-1}:\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(Y)\to\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)$. It
is defined as follows: $$f_</em>(U)=\bigcup_{f^{-1}(V)\subseteq U}V.$$ In
other words, an open set $U\subseteq X$ maps under $f_*$ to the
<em>largest</em> open set in $Y$ that pulls back to some subset of $U$.</p>
<p>This is an elementary operation but not one that comes up in a standard
undergraduate topology course (at least a 20th century one!). Here&rsquo;s an
example that may help: imagine $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is some smooth
curve in the plane. Given an open interval $(a,b)\subseteq[0,1]$, its
image in the plane is a one-dimensional subset, so won&rsquo;t itself be open.
Instead to compute $f_*((a,b))$ we have to find the largest open set in
the plane whose inverse image is $(a,b)$, which will look like <em>all of
$\mathbb{R}^2$</em> minus two skinny pieces of the curve that are the images
of $[0,a]$ and $[b,1]$. So it has the image in it, plus all the rest of
the plane that isn&rsquo;t in the image of the rest of $[0,1]$.</p>
<p>The requirement that $f_<em>$ give the <em>largest</em> open set such that some
condition holds should remind us of a nucleus. In fact given a sublocale
$f:X\to Y$ then $f_</em> \circ f^{-1}$ is the nucleus for the sublocale! It
maps an open set to the direct image of its inverse image, which will be
the largest open that contains the one you started with, and which
itself also maps back to the same open in $X$.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get back to considering the inclusion
$i:\mathbb{Q}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}$. The push-forward map $i_*$
sends the open set &ldquo;all of $\mathbb{Q}$&rdquo; in $\mathbb{Q}$ to the largest
open in $\mathbb{R}$ whose inverse image is contained in $\mathbb{Q}$.
But $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense so this is all of $\mathbb{R}$! There&rsquo;s no
smaller open that contains the rationals! The requirement that this
push-forward be an open set is forbidding us from carving out these
pathological dense subsets in the category of locales. The topological
glue of the real numbers is constraining what kind of subobjects we have
access to.</p>
<h1 id="measure-theory">Measure theory</h1>
<p>We have prepared all the abstract background. We have a new setting for
topology called locale theory, which has broken away from the concept of
a point. We have seen that the monomorphisms are different than in the
category of topological spaces, and we have examples of sublocales that
have no points. Let&rsquo;s bring measure theory into the mix and define
randomness in this setting.</p>
<p>Technically we are back to requiring the &ldquo;$\sigma-$&rdquo; on the words
&ldquo;frame&rdquo;, &ldquo;locale&rdquo; and &ldquo;sublocale&rdquo; so that we can reconnect with the
countability requirements of measures. On the other hand many spaces we
care about are &ldquo;strongly Lindelöf&rdquo; and we can drop the $\sigma-$.
Simpson works out the details in [@simpson]. To be strongly Lindelöf
means that for any collection of open sets, their union is contained in
a <em>countable</em> union of open sets. This includes $\mathbb{R}$. For the
rest of the essay we&rsquo;ll assume we are dealing with strongly Lindelöf
spaces and we&rsquo;ll drop the $\sigma-$, but of course the full theory can
be more general if we want.</p>
<p>We will define a measure on a locale/frame and then extend it to all the
sublocales of the frame.</p>
<p>A measure on a frame is a function $\mu:F\to [0,\infty]$ satisfying
$$\mu(\bot)=0$$ $$x\leq y\implies \mu(x)\leq\mu(y)$$
$$\mu(x)+\mu(y)=\mu(x\vee y)+\mu(x\wedge y)\quad\mathrm{(&ldquo;modularity&rdquo;)}$$
$$(x_i)<em>{i\geq 0}\mathrm{\ ascending\ }\implies \mu(\bigvee</em>{i\geq 0}x_i)=\sup_{i\geq 0}\mu(x_i)\quad\mathrm{(&ldquo;continuity&rdquo;)}.$$
We say $\mu$ is a probability measure if $\mu(\top)=1$. We will also
call $\mu$ a measure on a locale if it is a measure on the corresponding
frame of opens.</p>
<p>To bring the concept of measure to sublocales we will generalize the
concept of outer measure. We say a locale is <em>fitted</em> if for every
sublocale $Y\subseteq X$ it holds that $Y=\bigwedge\mathcal{N}(Y)$ where
$\mathcal{N}(Y)={U\in\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}(X)|Y\subseteq U}$, the
family of opens containing $Y$. We extend the measure $\mu$ to a measure
$\mu^<em>$ on any sublocale by $\mu^</em>(Y)=\inf_{U\in\mathcal{N}(Y)}\mu(U)$,
i.e. the limit of the measure of the open sets that intersect to $Y$.
There is work to show that spaces we care about are fitted, and that
this definition really defines a measure (see section 5 of [@simpson]).</p>
<p>We can now cash in the fact that we cannot decompose locales into two
dense sublocales. Simpson [@simpson] proves in Example 4.7 that the
standard measure on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, which extends to a
measure on sublocales in the way we just defined, is preserved under
Euclidean translations. This measure agrees with Lebesgue measure
whenever the sublocale agrees with a measurable set. In standard measure
theory there is no translation invariant measure on arbitrary subsets of
$\mathbb{R}^n$ due to pathological examples like cosets of rational
numbers, which of course are automatically avoided in locale theory.</p>
<h2 id="the-random-sublocale">The random sublocale</h2>
<p>We are ready to define the random sublocale
$\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}_X$ of an arbitrary locale $X$ equipped with a
probability measure $\mu$. We&rsquo;ll do it three times, once for each
definition of sublocale.</p>
<p>The spatial definition of $\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}<em>X$ is the smallest
sublocale of measure 1, or equivalently the intersection of all
sublocales of measure 1. This tracks exactly with the definition of
Kurtz randomness seen in the algorithmic randomness literature. It&rsquo;s
morally similar to $X</em>{\neg\neg}$ but making use of measure.
$X_{\neg\neg}$ is the smallest dense sublocale of $X$, whereas
$\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}_X$ is the smallest measure-1 sublocale.</p>
<p>The quotient definition of $\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}<em>X$ is the
equivalence relation $=</em>{\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}<em>X}$ given by
$U=</em>{\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}_X} V \iff \mu(U)=\mu(U\cap V)=\mu(V)$.
Opens are equivalent if they cover the same piece of space with equal
measure.</p>
<p>The nucleus definition is not mentioned by Simpson, but obviously it&rsquo;s
given by
$j_{\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}<em>X}(U) = \bigcup</em>{V\supseteq U, \mu(U)=\mu(V)}V.$
In other words, it maps $U$ to the maximal open that contains $U$ and
has the same measure as $U$.</p>
<p>This sublocale has no points! Given a point $p\in X$, the set $X-{p}$
has measure 1 and so $\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}_X\subseteq X-{p}$ and
so $p$ is not present in the random sublocale. Equating sets blurs away
the points like $\neg\neg$ does.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-open-sets-vs-randomness">Conclusion: open sets vs randomness</h1>
<p>Topology is about open sets, and open sets correspond to semideciadable
properties, i.e. properties that can be verified in finite time, but
might need infinite time to refute. This is philosophically adjacent to
being computable and constructive. In the Cantor space of binary
sequences, the open sets are unions of cylinders, which are finite
prefixes of sequences. We can verify propositions about infinite
sequences just when we can do it in finite time. The finiteness is the
openness and vice versa.</p>
<p>Locales take just the open sets from topology and build from there,
without allowing us to have points unless we can construct them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that locales behave very differently! There have smallest
dense subsets so you can&rsquo;t decompose the reals into a disjoint union of
rational and irrational. The topological glue constrains you from doing
this.</p>
<p>Measure theory can be done on locales and it avoids some pathological
problems that set theory causes. And we can form a smallest full-measure
sublocale, &ldquo;random sublocale.&rdquo; This sublocale has no points.</p>
<p>So if we revisit our set theoretic foundations and consider open sets to
be primary, then we arrive at a definition of randomness where the
randoms constitute a space with full measure but no points. This makes
perfect sense once you appreciate that having points requires work to
produce one, but random points can never be fully produced.</p>
<p>This simple presentation gives the appearance, at least to me, that
locale theory permits only one definition of randomness, which if true
would be a major disadvantage. Algorithmic randomness contains a few
moving parts such as whether certain measures can be computably
obtained, or whether convergence of a limit is computable or can be
computably bounded. Can we gain control over analogous parts of the
theory within locale theory? Or are we stuck with Kurtz randomness?
There are indications that the Borel hierarchy of sets can be imported
into locale theory<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> from which we could obtain weak $n$-randomness,
so that would be the logical next step to flesh out.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is another option, which is that locale theory may not by
itself offer control over all the extra choices contained in the theory
of algorithmic randomness, but that passing from locales to the theory
of assemblies in a realizability topos may offer them instead. Topos
theory is built on top of locale theory, so this would be like
continuing the narrative. In such a case locales would offer the unified
big picture of the origins of randomness, which are then exported to
different implementations.</p>
<p>Lastly let me speculate on the role of almost-everywhere properties in
locale theory. I imagine we could replace statements like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$x\in [0,1]$ is Schnorr random if and only if every computable
function $f$ of bounded variation with effectively integrable
derivative $f&rsquo;$ is differentiable at $x$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ is a morphism in $\mathsf{Loc}$, then $f$ is
differentiable on $\ensuremath{\mathrm{Ran}}_{[0,1]}$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could perhaps drop the explicit requirement of computability because
we&rsquo;d be in a constructive framework already, and instead of stating the
result pointwise we&rsquo;d have a global statement. It remains to properly
define smoothness in the locale framework and to work out many details!</p>
