class="header-section-number">2</span> First introduction: homotopy type
theory</h1>
<p>For people trained in classical mathematics, as the author was,
homotopy type theory (HoTT) is a major change of perspective. It is a
new foundational system for mathematics which foregrounds fibrations and
classifying spaces, and which defaults to a constructive philosophy. It
is similar in those ways to the theory underpinning Lean and the
formalization work happening in that community. But beyond that it also
retains full fidelity of higher groupoidal structures and so supports
homotopy theory directly in the syntax. The emphasis on syntax is quite
alien to classical mathematicians, partially because that’s where the
emphasis on foundations truly takes place, something workaday
mathematicians don’t concern themselves with. This disorientation is
acknowledged and soothed in perhaps the best starting point for HoTT for
mathematicians, a survey by Mike Shulman<span class="citation"
data-cites="shulman_logic_of_space"> (<a
href="#ref-shulman_logic_of_space" role="doc-biblioref">Shulman,
2017b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The goal of this paper is to try to indicate just how much of
differential geometry is emergent from the syntax of HoTT, making it a
powerful new tool to prove theorems and generalize them to higher
structures. For any differential geometer wishing to triangulate along
with me between HoTT and geometry there is no better companion than Dan
Freed and Mike Hopkins’ treatment of differential geometry through the
lens of homotopy theory<span class="citation"
data-cites="freed2013chernweil"> (<a href="#ref-freed2013chernweil"
role="doc-biblioref">Freed &amp; Hopkins, 2013</a>)</span>. Bringing all
of their results into the HoTT framework would be a natural program that
could follow from our discussion here.</p>
<h1 data-number="3"
id="second-introduction-discrete-differential-geometry"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Second introduction: discrete
differential geometry</h1>
<p>The observation that sparks the following discussion is this: if we
can manage to reformulate differential geometry in discrete terms (i.e.
finite, without infinitesimals) then we may also be able to construct it
synthetically in homotopy type theory. Furthermore, if we do capture
geometry in HoTT then there’s a chance that it can become clearer and
smaller. We would then have new tools, a new audience, and a new program
to (re)explore geometry, gauge theory, low dimensional topology, and
mathematical physics.</p>
<p>Applied mathematicians and computer scientists have been developing
discrete differential geometry (DDG) for many years. The 2003 Ph.D.
thesis of Anil Hirani <span class="citation" data-cites="hiranidec"> (<a
href="#ref-hiranidec" role="doc-biblioref">Hirani, 2003</a>)</span> (see
also the multi-author follow-up <span class="citation"
data-cites="desbrundec"> (<a href="#ref-desbrundec"
role="doc-biblioref">Desbrun <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>)</span>) defines
finite versions of vector fields, differential forms, the wedge product,
the Hodge star, and several differential operators (exterior derivative,
div, grad, curl, Laplace-Beltrami, Lie derivative). Hirani and others
cite Whitney’s 1957 book <em>Geometric Integration Theory</em><span
class="citation" data-cites="whitney1957"> (<a href="#ref-whitney1957"
role="doc-biblioref">Whitney, 1957</a>)</span> which develops a theory
of cochains by integrating smooth forms over chains. In 2004 Melvil
Leok, Jerrold Marsden, and Alan Weinstein <span class="citation"
data-cites="leok"> (<a href="#ref-leok" role="doc-biblioref">Leok <em>et
al.</em>, 2005</a>)</span> defined discrete connections on principal
bundles. This is probably the work most spiritually similar to this
paper. The motivation for the above constructions was applied
mathematics: modeling the differential equations of mechanics and fluid
mechanics with the so-called “finite element” methods. The theory has
been adopted and extended by the computer graphics community as well
(see Keenan Crane’s course notes <span class="citation"
data-cites="crane_ddg"> (<a href="#ref-crane_ddg"
role="doc-biblioref">Crane <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>)</span> for a
gentle survey).</p>
<p>The applied category theory community has begun to develop category
theoretic foundations and software libraries to increase the reusability
and compositionality of finite element methods in science and
engineering problems. See for example recent work to bring discrete
exterior calculus into the AlgebraicJulia library <span class="citation"
data-cites="morris_decapodes"> (<a href="#ref-morris_decapodes"

<p>For these classically-minded applied mathematicians DDG is defined on
combinatorial manifolds such as simplicial complexes or polytopes, of
any finite dimension. The 0-cells play the role of points, the 1-cells
are path segments, and so on. They define <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-forms as functions on the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional faces of the manifold into
the real numbers, which is then extended by linearity to arbitrary <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-chains. Exterior differentiation is
defined by Stokes theorem (which is no longer a theorem in this
setting), by which we mean the following.</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>. <em>(Exterior derivative in DDG.) Let
<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> be an <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>-form on a combinatorial manifold
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> be an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-face of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span> be the boundary operator on
faces. The exterior derivative <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is
defined by <span class="math display">\[d\omega(\Omega) =
\omega(\partial\Omega).\]</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>At this point a study of DDG would move into chain complexes, where
the forms of different dimensions are combined through the grading.
Grassman algebras would be introduced, to convey the dependence of forms
on orientation. The Leibniz rule (product rule) would be explored.
Defining connections and curvature require constructing a codomain that
is group-like and then creating more definitions about transport and
holonomy. At that point major theorems like Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Weil
would be available to prove.</p>
<p>We will take a different path. We will not define forms, complexes,
or Grassman algebras at all. We will view ordinary HoTT functions out of
a type as <em>synthetic discrete differential forms</em>. The codomain
will be a central H-space, which combines the features of the real
numbers (in that functions can be pointwise multiplied) and classifying
spaces of groups (so that maps into the H-space can classify bundles).
We will then merely <em>observe</em> the emergence of various aspects of
geometry.</p>
<p>We won’t be able to answer every question, so eventually we will stop
and point to future directions.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="central-h-spaces"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Central H-spaces</h1>
<p>Central H-spaces are the classifying spaces for principal bundles on
abelian groups. We won’t be able to access the full theory for
nonabelian groups just yet, but we hope that the theory of maximal tori
and weights might bring even those within reach of the central H-space
paradigm.</p>
<p>We will rely on the lovely paper by Buchholtz, Christensen, Flaten
and Rijke <span class="citation" data-cites="buchholtz2023central"> (<a

<p>We will also be looking in detail at maps into the classifying space

summarized by:</p>
<div class="mythm">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>. <em>For any central H-space <span

class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and is equivalent to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(A)\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\sum_{X:\mathcal{U}}||X=A||_0.\)</span>
This delooping is also a central H-space and so can be infinitely
delooped.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This means that we can form a sequence of deloopings <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}}, S^1,
\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1), \ldots\)</span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="higher-maps-contain-connections"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Higher maps contain
connections</h1>
<p>To hew close to the intended context of the term “connection” we will
examine manifold-like types mapping into bundle-classifying-like types.
The novelty here, compared to other HoTT investigations, is the focus on
combinatorial types to stand in for manifolds.</p>
<p>In recent times it has been believed in the HoTT community that maps
from a discrete type to a discrete classifying space can encode only the
connections that a classical mathematician would call <em>flat</em>
(zero curvature). In this context the word <em>discrete</em> means
having the discrete topology, in the sense of cohesion<span
class="citation" data-cites="shulman_cohesion"> (<a
href="#ref-shulman_cohesion" role="doc-biblioref">Shulman,
2017a</a>)</span>. This is not the case! We will show that if the
codomain is a classifying space of <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> or other group of homotopy dimension
at least 1, then non-flat connections appear despite the type <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> being topologically discrete. Another
common meaning of the shorthand “discrete” is to indicate a 0-truncated
type, i.e. a set, as opposed to a type with higher homotopical
structures. We will show that indeed if the codomain classifies sets,
which is the case for example with the classifying space <span
class="math inline">\(B\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}}\)</span>, the delooping
of <span class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}}\)</span>, then
connections are flat. (The type we denote by <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{S}^1\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\{(x,
y)|x^2+y^2=1\}\)</span> is a set and is not topologically discrete. We
will not be discussing it at all in this paper.)</p>
<p>The DDG philosophy tells us to look at HITs that are polytope-like. A
polytope <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will have finitely many
0-dimesional (point) constructors <span
class="math inline">\(\{m_0^i\}\)</span>, finitely many 1-dimesnional
constructors <span
class="math inline">\(\{m_1^{ij}:m_0^i=m_0^j\}\)</span>, and so on. Type
families <span class="math inline">\(f:M\to \mathcal{U}\)</span> on this
type specify where each of these constructors is sent. In DDG parlance,
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> restricted to the 0-dimensional
constructors of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a 0-form and
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> restricted to the 1-dimensional
constructors (not the 1-skeleton but just the 1-dimensional parts,
whatever that means in HoTT) is a 1-form, and so on.</p>
<p>A principal <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> bundle is a
family of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> torsors and so we
will often be focusing on the function type <span
class="math inline">\(M\to \mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span>. The novel
claim here is that <span class="math inline">\(M\to
\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> contains more than just all the principal
<span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>-bundles: it also contains all
the connections on all the bundles. Every connection is present, both
curved and flat, because we have complete freedom to specify the images
of the paths.</p>
<p>Classically, curvature is a property of the connection. It is
computed either on infinitesimal loops, or on the infinitesimal surface
bounded by the loop. In fact it is “the derivative of the connection”
morally speaking. Getting into the details would wreck the simplicity
we’re going for<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. We will look for curvature by
examining <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on 1-dimensional loops.
If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is at least a 2-type and if we
want to claim that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> classifies a
bundle with connection, then we will be required to map the 2-faces of
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (the 2-dimesional constructors)
to a path from <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathsf{refl}}\)</span> to the image
of a bounding loop. So at dimension 2 we will impose that constraint.
Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> is
2-truncated, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> factors through the
truncation map <span class="math inline">\(M\to||M||_2\)</span> and so
that’s the top dimension.</p>
<p>There is an example at the end of this paper. For those who are best
served by examples, do look at it and return to this point.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="why-this-is-geometry"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Why this is geometry</h1>
<p>How can we double check that we are describing the intended theory of
geometry? In this section we will enumerate a wishlist of facts that we
believe characterize the subject, and then provide evidence for some of
them.</p>
<p>Here are the translations that are covered in the current paper:

<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 4</strong>. <em>An <em>Ehresmann connection</em>
on a principal bundle <span class="math inline">\(\pi:P\to M\)</span>
with Lie group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a splitting
<span class="math inline">\(TP=VP\oplus HP\)</span> at every point of
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> into vertical and “horizontal”
subspaces, which is preserved by the action of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Aut}P\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Being preserved by the action of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Aut}P\)</span> means that the
complementary horizontal subspaces in a given fiber of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi:P\to M\)</span> are determined by the
splitting at any single point in the fiber. The action of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on this fiber can then push the
splitting around to all the other points.</p>
<p>The motivation for this definition is that we now have an isomorphism
<span class="math inline">\(T_p\pi:H_pP\to T_{\pi(p)}M\)</span> between
each horizontal space and the tangent space below it in <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. This means that given a tangent vector
at <span class="math inline">\(x:M\)</span> and a point <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(x)\)</span> we can uniquely lift the
tangent vector to a horizontal vector at <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We can also lift vector fields and
paths in this way. To lift a path <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma:[0,1]\to M\)</span> you must specify a lift
for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0)\)</span> and then lift the
tangent vectors of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and prove
that you can integrate the lift of that vector field upstairs in <span
class="math inline">\(HP\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then, armed with the lifting of paths one immediately obtains
isomorphisms between the fibers of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. So the Ehresmann connection, the
lifting of paths, and transport isomorphisms between fibers are all
recapitulations of the structure that the connection adds to the
bundle.</p>
<p>Moving now to HoTT, fix a type <span
class="math inline">\(M:\mathcal{U}\)</span> and a type family <span
class="math inline">\(f:M\to\mathcal{U}\)</span>. Path induction gives
us the transport isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{p:x=_M
y}\mathrm{tr}(p):f(x)=f(y)\)</span>. We can use this to define a type of
<em>dependent paths</em>, also called <em>pathovers</em> or <em>paths
over</em> a given path.</p>

call “the horizontal lift of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>

classical definition of a connection by defining <span

the projection onto the vertical component. And thus in HoTT we can see
the equivalence of transport and lifting of paths into horizontal and
vertical components.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="the-leibniz-product-rule"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> The Leibniz (product) rule</h2>
<p>The Leibniz rule for exterior differentiation states that if <span
class="math inline">\(f, g:M\to \ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> are two
smooth functions to the real numbers then <span
class="math inline">\(d(fg) = fdg + gdf\)</span>. Here <span
class="math inline">\(fg\)</span> is the function formed by taking the
pointwise product of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. This is an interaction between
multiplication in <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> and the action on
vectors of smooth functions (the 1-forms <span
class="math inline">\(df\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(dg\)</span>).</p>
<p>To examine this situation in HoTT we need type-theoretic functions
<span class="math inline">\(f, g:M\to B\)</span> from some type <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to a central H-space <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\mu:B\to B\to B\)</span> be the H-space
multiplication. How does <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> act on
paths? Suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(a, a&#39;, b,
b&#39;:B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p:a=_B a&#39;, q:b=_B
b&#39;\)</span>. Then we also have homotopies <span
class="math inline">\(\mu(p, -):\mu(a, -)=_{B\to B}\mu(a&#39;,
-)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu(-,q):\mu(-,b)=_{B\to
B}\mu(-,b&#39;).\)</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(\mu(a,

<p><img src="./d183777157a8a3e2d296890f77fb0c2aee7abf41.png"

<p>And so the two homotopies can be horizontally composed to give a path
<span class="math display">\[\mu(p,-)\star\mu(-,q): \mu(a,

and <span

<p>We can recognize the process of using whiskering to form horizontal
composition in the Leibniz rule.</p>
<p>Quick aside: moving from infinitesimal calculus to finite groupoid
algebra actually involves two changes. The first is the change from
vectors to paths, forms to functions and so on. But it’s also the case
that tangent vectors have just the one basepoint, whereas paths have two
endpoints. You can see this play out in this example, where <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span

<p>The horizontal composition we build lives entirely in <span

<h2 data-number="6.4" id="gauge-transformations"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Gauge transformations</h2>
<p>A <em>gauge transformation</em> is a term inherited from physics.
It’s an automorphism of a principal bundle <span
class="math inline">\(P\to M\)</span>, meaning a homeomorphism of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that commutes with the projection to
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and so acts on each fiber. It is
further required to be equivariant under the action of the group <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and so it’s very similar to the act of
multiplying each fiber by a continuously varying element of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>In HoTT if the bundle is classified by <span
class="math inline">\(f:M\to \mathcal{U}\)</span> then an automorphism
is a homotopy <span class="math inline">\(f\sim f\)</span> and the group
of gauge transformations is the loop space <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_f(M\to \mathcal{U})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recall that torsors have a physical interpretation as a quantity
without a specified unit, such as mass, length, or time. When we choose
a base point in a torsor it becomes the standard torsor <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acting on itself (for example, the
additive real numbers). A physicist is looking for properties or laws
that are independent of such a choice. In the 20th century physicists
further wondered about choices of units that vary from point to point,
and began searching for laws that are invariant under this much larger
space of transformations. And so they and we are led to explore
quotienting by the action of the group of gauge transformations, and in
particular the space of connections “mod gauge.” In this scenario the
base manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is spacetime, and a
gauge transformation is a smoothly varying choice of gauge (units) at
each point.</p>
<p>Gauge transformations act on connections. When we view connections as
infinitesimal splittings of <span class="math inline">\(TP\)</span> into
vertical and horizontal sub-bundles, a gauge transformation that is
constant in the neighborhood of a point will not change the splitting,
it will just shift the fiber rigidly along itself, but one that is
changing rapidly near a point will tilt the horizontal subspaces. So
there are two effects: the effect of sliding along the fiber, and the
effect of the rate of change of the gauge transformation. In classical
geometry you’ll see formulas like this:</p>
<div class="mythm">
<p><strong>Theorem 3</strong>. <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\to
M\)</span> be a principal bundle and <span
class="math inline">\(A\in\Omega^1(M,\mathfrak{g})\)</span> a connection

class="math inline">\(H\in \mathscr{G}(P)\)</span> is a bundle

class="math display">\[H^*A=\mathrm{Ad}_{H_U(x)^{-1}}\circ A +
H_U^*(\mu_G)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_G:\Omega^1(G,\mathfrak{g})\)</span> is the
Maurer-Cartan form on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This theorem is a combination of Theorems 5.2.2 and 5.4.4 in the
excellent recent book on gauge theory for mathematicians interested in
physics by Mark Hamilton<span class="citation"
data-cites="hamilton2017"> (<a href="#ref-hamilton2017"
role="doc-biblioref">Hamilton, 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s not so important to fully understand this formula because we
will re-explain it in HoTT terms in a moment. But notice that <span
class="math inline">\(H^*A\)</span> (the action of the gauge
transformation on the connection 1-form) has contributions from two
terms (both of which are vertical — connections always map onto the
vertical bundle). The first is the adjoint action at the specific point
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. This is always what we expect
when we shift the base point in a torsor and look at the resulting group
(or in this case, the Lie algebra). The second term involves the
Maurer-Cartan form, which is the derivative of subtraction in the group.
It takes tangent vectors at <span class="math inline">\(g:G\)</span> to
a tangent vector at the identity (the Lie algebra, denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span>) by differentiating the
action of multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\)</span>.
If we think in terms of finite-length paths, then imagine a path <span
class="math inline">\(p:g=g&#39;\)</span> and the function <span
class="math inline">\((g^{-1}\cdot -)\)</span>. The function will act on
the path to give a path <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\cdot
p:e=(g&#39;\cdot g^{-1})\)</span> that starts at the identity. So the
Maurer-Cartan form shifts paths to start at the identity by subtracting
off the start point. Our Maurer-Cartan term is the pullback of the
Maurer-Cartan form by <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> which
records how <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> acts infinitesimally,
i.e. the contribution from the gauge transformation <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> that comes from the rapidity of change
from point to point. This term will be large when <span
class="math inline">\(H_U\)</span> has a large derivative.</p>

<p>Every topological manifold has a handlebody structure except in

if it is smoothable. This is a theorem on page 136 of Freedman and
Quinn’s book “Topology of 4-Manifolds”, with a reference given to the
Kirby-Siebenmann book for the higher-dimensional case. It is then an
elementary fact that an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-manifold
with a handlebody structure is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with
one <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cell for each <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-handle, so in particular there are no
cells of dimension greater than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
At least in the compact case a manifold with a handlebody structure is
in fact homeomorphic to a CW complex with <span

<p>The usual HoTT <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> are a little impoverished, and seeing
connections and curvature is difficult. Instead we will define
equivalent HITs that have more constructors. The representation of the

<p>The Rubik’s cube has a convenient standardized arrangement of colors
that start with different letters (white, yellow, blue, orange, green,
red) so we will use those to label our points, especially since having
such a cube handy is very helpful to visualize some of the geometry that
is encoded below as mere lists of data.</p>
<p>Should the 0-dimensional constructors represent the corners or the
faces? We have so far found it intuitive to imagine taking the nerve of
a good open cover, where the top-dimensional bulk of the cube, namely
the faces, is converted to a point since an open set covering that face
is contractible. That’s why we end up with an icosohedron, which is a
dual polyhedron to the cube.</p>
<p>We won’t discuss in detail the fact that Mike Shulman’s shape
operator <span class="citation" data-cites="shulman_cohesion"> (<a

forming a HIT from the overlap data. The shape operator preserves
colimits and so the simple homotopy pushouts we are considering should
be within the use cases of shape.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 4</strong>. <em><span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{O}}\simeq
S^2\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>Proof.</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{O}}\)</span> is the join of
<span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> and a two-point type. For more
discussion of the join operation see the HoTT book section 8.5<span
class="citation" data-cites="hottbook"> (<a href="#ref-hottbook"

2013</a>)</span>. ◻</p>
<p>To produce a term in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> we need <span
class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> and a choice of an equivalence class
of equivalences with <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>:</p>
<div class="mylemma">
<p><strong>Lemma 5</strong>. <em>We have <span
class="math inline">\((C_4, ||\{b, r, g, o\}\mapsto \mathsf{base},
br\mapsto \mathsf{loop}, \{rg, go, ob\}\mapsto
\ensuremath{\mathsf{refl}}||_0):\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>There are other near-to-hand terms of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> we can denote like:
<span class="math inline">\([w, o, y, r]\)</span>, meaning the square
isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> but with the
given four points, with pointing given by whichever point we listed
first, and with equivalence with <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> chosen so that the path between the
first two points maps to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{loop}\)</span>. We will also introduce
notation for maps <span class="math inline">\(f:[a, b, c, d]\to [w, x,
y, z]\)</span> by indicating where each item in the domain list is sent,
like so: <span class="math inline">\(f\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}[[x, y,
z, w]]\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> has an unpointed
automorphism connected to the identiy which will play the role of
rotation by 90 degrees:</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 7</strong>. <em>Let <span
class="math inline">\(R:C_4\to C_4\)</span> be the cyclic permutation

R(br)=rg, R(rg)=go, R(go)=ob, R(ob)=br.\)</span> Let <span
class="math inline">\(R&#39;:R=\ensuremath{\text{id}}\)</span> be the
obvious homotopy to the identity.</em></p>
</div>
<p>To construct a map <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{O}}\to\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span>
we need to send each vertex to an <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>-torsor such as <span
class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>. We will choose to send each vertex
to “the clockwise equator if this was the north pole.”</p>

<p>Extending this to the 1-skeleton requires various choices. We will
choose the one that reflects the tangent bundle, using the transport we
can intuitively see through the embedding of <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{O}}\)</span> in 3-dimensional
space as in our pictures. If you focus for a moment just on a path <span
class="math inline">\(w\to b\to r\)</span> and imagine rigidly tipping a
moving equator along with a moving point, you can imagine a
moving-equator point that starts at <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and stays fixed when the north pole
slides from <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. When the north pole continues sliding
from <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> the moving-equator point moves to <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. Then it remains fixed when the north
pole slides from <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> up to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. So all in all we “moved <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.” When we track all the points on the
original <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>-equator we see that we
performed the rotation we earlier named <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general we have:</p>

given by transport around the boundary.</p>
