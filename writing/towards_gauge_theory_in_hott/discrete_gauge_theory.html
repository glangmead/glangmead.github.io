</blockquote>
<p>Homotopy type theory (HoTT) is a logical foundation for mathematics
that adds to set theory several important mathematical patterns. Among
these are <em>fibrations</em>, <em>(higher) groupoids</em>, and
<em>classifying spaces</em> (called <em>universes</em>). It embodies the
philosophy of constructivism by unifying mathematical statements with
types and proofs with terms. It has an extensive syntax and a talented
team of theory builders who have labored for a decade to equip the
syntax with formal initiality proofs and categorical semantics that
together generate living, breathing proofs simultaneously in every
category with enough structure to support the semantics. It has
implementations in several computer languages which have attracted
multiple large formalization efforts. It benefits from an unusually
strong interdisciplinary culture spanning computer science, mathematics,
philosophy, and physics.</p>
<p>The hypothetical scope of HoTT is of course all of mathematics, past,
present and future. It contains set theory, and the law of excluded
middle and axiom of choice can be added whenever the intended semantics
supports them. It therefore invites us to use the rest of its tools to
enhance our understanding, and to seek better answers to <em>why</em>
questions in the same way that category theory sometimes tells us
<em>why</em> individual results across specific fields are true. Over
the last decade many results have been verified in HoTT, and many have
insightful new proofs. The topics that have received the most attention
so far include homotopy theory, algebraic topology, group theory,
category theory, and combinatorics. Our goal is to extend this list with
topics from geometry: connections, curvature, gauge theory,
characteristic classes, and Chern-Weil theory.</p>
<p>Gauge theory is a collection of tools inspired by, and in dialog
with, the standard model of particle physics. The quantum field theories
developed during the 20th century are mathematical models that supply
spacetime with additional structures: principal bundles, vector bundles,
sections of these bundles, and connections. The bundles provide internal
dimensions to quantum particles, which are visible experimentally
through phenomena such as charge, magnetism, mass, gravity, and quark
color. Forces are mediated by massless particles that correspond to the
connections. Particles are sections of associated vector bundles.
Physical laws are expressed by real- or complex-valued functions called
lagrangians, on the configuration space of all of this structure.</p>
<p>Mathematicians discovered that by adding their own gauge theory
structures to smooth manifolds of interest they could define new
invariants of the homotopy type, the homeomorphism class, or the
diffeomorphism class of the manifold. HoTT is not equipped today to
explore all of these scenarios since it is most developed in the world
of homotopy types only. There is beautiful work to bring in notions of
topology and smooth structure through the principal of <em>cohesion</em>
(the study of spatial relationships by way of operators that
<em>remove</em> such structure). We will touch on some of this and point
the way to future work, but for now we will focus on homotopical results
only.</p>
<p>For the HoTT-oriented audience my goal is to demonstrate that
connections and gauge theory are present in the realm of discrete types.
This can even serve as an introduction to classical differential
geometry, and today’s undergraduates who are drawn to HoTT can leverage
their intuitions to bypass a lot of confusing material!</p>
<p>For the geometry audience my goal is to offer an entirely new
perspective on the de Rham complex in general, and connections and
curvature in particular. My grandiose hope is that in this framing we
can find a natural and intuitive understanding of Chern-Weil theory,
i.e. the link between curvature and characteristic classes.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="non-infinitesimal-calculus"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Non-infinitesimal calculus</h1>
<p>Our plan is to examine differential geometry using finite methods:
using paths instead of vector fields. We will apply the syntax of type
theory and work through a first course in differential forms,
connections and curvature.</p>
<p>We will use a heuristic to guide us: whenever a classical statement
uses infinitesimal objects we should find an equivalent one that uses
finite objects. We should try to restate results involving tangent
vectors using finite-length paths instead. We should try to replace
1-forms with integrals of the 1-form over paths.</p>
<p>In addition to changing our perspective on classical geometry we will
make a concession on the type theory side: we will work with objects in
HoTT that are <em>discrete</em>, meaning devoid of cohesion or spatial
information. Manifolds will be combinatorial objects, not based on the
real numbers. There are three consolations for this loss: first, we will
still have access to results in gauge theory that depend only on the
homotopy type. Secondly we can approximate a curved manifold as closely
as we want by adding more points, paths, and so on to the mesh, bringing
more use cases into our construction. And lastly we will hopefully gain
a lot of insight into the inner workings of classical differential
geometry.</p>
<p>Classically, functions on the level of points such as a smooth
function between smooth manifolds <span class="math inline">\(f:M\to
N\)</span> can be differentiated to yield a new function that acts on
both points and tangent vectors: <span class="math inline">\(Tf:TM\to
TN\)</span>. There is no new data in <span
class="math inline">\(Tf\)</span>, its action on vectors is computed in
terms of its action on points. We package the derived (no pun) data into
a new function that acts on both points and vectors. Passing through the
heuristic we proposed, we would instead package the derived information
as the action on finite-length paths in <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Tangent vectors are equivalence
classes of such paths anyway, so it seems no information is lost. This
would mean that taking the derivative of a smooth function is the same
as to extract its action on paths.</p>
<p>The derivative is a particular action on paths, one that is entailed
in the original function on points. Classically the derivative can be
pulled apart to examine <em>only</em> its action on paths, often called
<span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>. This is a 1-form, meaning a
section of the cotangent bundle. A 1-form is an object defined on all of
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> which can be integrated over a
path to give a number. Again, a function on paths. An arbitrary 1-form
is some function on paths, and <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>
is one such.</p>
<p>HoTT also has functions, but those functions always act in all the
available dimensions of the type all at once. It is inherently a
function on points, paths, and higher paths. We can look at what <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> does to paths using the construction
<span class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathsf{ap}}f\)</span>. At this
point there is an important check we can make. <span
class="math inline">\(df\)</span> has a few important properties, the
most characteristic of which is the Leibniz, or product rule. Is this
visible in HoTT?</p>
<p>The Leibniz rule states that if <span class="math inline">\(f, g:M\to
\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> are two smooth functions to the real
numbers then <span class="math inline">\(d(fg) = fdg + gdf\)</span>.
Here <span class="math inline">\(fg\)</span> is the function formed by
taking the pointwise product of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. To examine this situation in
HoTT we need type-theoretic functions <span class="math inline">\(f,
g:M\to B\)</span> from some type <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
to an H-space <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<div class="mydef">

<p>The classical 2-sphere embedded in <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}^3\)</span> is curved at
every point. But we can quantize this curvature by integrating it over a
triangulation. Consider two great circles at 90 degree angles to each
other, passing through the north and south pole, and take the equator.
Convert this data into a combinatorial structure:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The set of vertices <span class="math inline">\(\{w, y, b, g, r,
o, y\}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the
north pole, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> the south pole, and
around the equator are the points of intersection of the three circles,
labeled in eastward order <span class="math inline">\(\{b, o, g,
r\}\)</span>. The names come from the colors on a standard Rubik’s
cube.</p></li>
<li><p>The set of edges generated by the direct paths between adjacent
vertices, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\{wb\}, \{wo\}\)</span>
and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>The set of faces generated by the triangular regions bounded by
three vertices and three paths, denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\{wbo\}, \{wog\}\)</span> and so on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Parallel transport in the tangent bundle around the <span
class="math inline">\(\{wog\}\)</span> face will rotate a tangent vector
by 90 degrees clockwise. This is true for all the triangular faces and
so the sum of the action of all 8 faces will be two rotations around the
circle. We can compare this result to the standard smooth Gauss-Bonnet
theorem.</p>
<p>We can leverage the syntax of HoTT by encoding the above in a map
between HITs.</p>

<p>We now want to extend this map to all of <span

computed from the connection, it doesn’t contain any new data.
Classically the integral of curvature over a 2-cell is the holonomy
given by transport around the boundary. Can we make this idea type

called <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span>. In a similar way all

fact that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> is a

<h1 data-number="4" id="gauge-transformations"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Gauge transformations</h1>
<p>A <em>gauge transformation</em> is a term inherited from physics.
It’s an automorphism of a principal bundle <span
class="math inline">\(P\to X\)</span>, meaning a homeomorphism of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that commutes with the projection to
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and so acts on each fiber. It is
further required to be equivariant under the action of the group <span

multiplying each fiber by a continuously varying element of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>In HoTT this is easy to express. If a bundle <span
class="math inline">\(P\to X\)</span> is classified by <span
