<p>We introduce discrete gauge theory.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory">Gauge theory</a>
is a general methodology for defining invariants of spaces, whether
those be invariants of the homotopy type, the homomorphism class, or the
diffeomorphism class. We make use of mediating objects such as principal
bundles over the space, connections on the bundles, and morphisms of
these. These additional objects provide access to information beyond the
homology and homotopy groups of the space, but they are also of direct
interest as well. In physics, the fields that model matter particles are
sections of bundles, and those that model force fields are connections.
The laws of nature are postulated to be invariant under automorphisms of
all the underlying principal bundles, and so all the objects we need to
study topology are relevant in physics as well!</p>
<p>The standard introductions to differential geometry and gauge theory
work at the infinitesimal level. Connections are differential forms with
values in the Lie algebra of a Lie group, forms are sections of a skew
symmetric product of cotangent spaces. This fine local structure is so
far inaccessible to homotopy type theory, even with modalities such as
those offered by differential cohesion. These modalities are intriguing
but very alien to classical intuitions. We won’t be saying more about
that line of investigation.</p>
<p>There is another approach, which is to draw inspiration from discrete
and combinatorial methods. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_differential_geometry">Discrete
differential geometry</a> is an active field of applied mathematics and
computer science, which has reused or created definitions of vector
field, differential form, connection and curvature, that apply to a
triangulated surface embedded in 3-dimensional space (as might be used
in a computer graphics engine).</p>
<p>Algebraic topology of course has always had a train of thought
devoted to combinatorial approximations to smooth or continuous spaces,
a major example of which is the notion of a CW complex. The theory of
piecewise linear (PL) manifolds is another important example where a
finite structure is used to capture important properties of a space.</p>
<p>Such complexes are easy to define in homotopy type theory, as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory#The_univalence_axiom,_synthetic_homotopy_theory,_and_higher_inductive_types">higher
inductive types</a>. We will see a lot of examples shortly. Can we
define bundles, forms and connections on these?</p>
