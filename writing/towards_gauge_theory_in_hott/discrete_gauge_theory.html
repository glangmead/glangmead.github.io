<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>We use combinatorial manifolds and torus groups to bring the study of
connections on principal bundles into homotopy type theory. We intend
this document to be an introduction to modern geometry and gauge theory
for anyone familiar with homotopy type theory. The hope is that it works
vice-versa as well.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A literate Markdown+Agda version of this document <a
href="https://github.com/glangmead/writing/blob/master/differential_geometry_in_hott/agda/discrete_gauge_theory.lagda.md">is
available as well</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory">Gauge theory</a>
is a general methodology for defining invariants of spaces, including
invariants of the homotopy type, the homomorphism class, or the
diffeomorphism class. We make use of mediating objects such as principal
bundles over the space, connections on the bundles, and morphisms of
these. These additional objects provide access to information beyond the
homology and homotopy groups of the space, but they are also of direct
interest as well. In physics the fields that model force fields are
connections, and the fields that model matter particles are sections of
associated vector bundles. The laws of nature are postulated to be
invariant under automorphisms of all the underlying principal bundles,
and so all the objects we need to study topology are relevant in physics
as well!</p>
<p>The standard treatments of differential geometry and gauge theory
work at the infinitesimal level. Connections are differential forms with
values in the Lie algebra of a Lie group, rather than functions from
finite-length paths directly into the Lie group. This fine local
structure is so far inaccessible to homotopy type theory, even with
modalities such as those offered by differential cohesion. These
modalities are intriguing but very alien to classical intuitions. We
won’t be saying more about that line of investigation.</p>
<p>There is another approach, which is to draw inspiration from discrete
and combinatorial methods. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_differential_geometry">Discrete
differential geometry</a> is an active field of applied mathematics and
computer science which has developed combinatorial versions of vector
fields, differential forms, connections and curvature, defined on a
triangulated surface embedded in 3-dimensional space (as might be used
in a computer graphics engine).</p>
<p>Algebraic topology of course has always had a train of thought
devoted to combinatorial approximations to smooth or continuous spaces,
a major example of which is the notion of a CW complex. The theory of
piecewise linear (PL) manifolds is another important example where a
finite structure is used to capture important properties of a space.</p>
<p>Such complexes are easy to define in homotopy type theory, as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory#The_univalence_axiom,_synthetic_homotopy_theory,_and_higher_inductive_types">higher
inductive types</a>. We will see a lot of examples shortly. How much of
gauge theory can we define with these?</p>
<h2 id="not-the-fundamental-groupoid-not-the-path-groupoid">Not the
fundamental groupoid, not the path groupoid</h2>
<p>There are a few avenues folks have pursued to treat the theory of
connections in category theory or homotopy type theory. John Baez and
collaborators <span class="citation"
data-cites="baez_schreiber_higher_gauge">(<a
href="#ref-baez_schreiber_higher_gauge" role="doc-biblioref">Baez &amp;
Schreiber, 2006</a>)</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="baez_huerta_higher_gauge">(<a
href="#ref-baez_huerta_higher_gauge" role="doc-biblioref">Baez &amp;
Huerta, 2010</a>)</span> have emphasized the <em>path groupoid</em>
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_1(X)\)</span> of a manifold
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, which is a sort of infinitary
higher inductive type whose points are the points of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, whose morphisms are so-called <em>thin
homotopy</em> classes of smooth paths (paths up to a homotopy that is
1-dimensional, for example a reparameterization of the path that simply
changes speed but has the same image and orientation), and where
composition of paths is carefully defined so that compositions are
always smooth. A connection is then simply a functor <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_1(X)\to BG\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> is a one-object groupoid whose
morphisms form the group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>The path groupoid construction has not been defined in HoTT, and it’s
not clear that it can be done or whether it’s worthwhile to do so. A
related object which has been defined in HoTT is the <em>fundamental
groupoid</em> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, whose points
are the points of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and whose paths
are homotopy classes of paths. This is the 1-truncation of the full
<em>fundamental <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>-groupoid</em> of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which does not take equivalence classes
but retains all the paths and adds higher equalities for the homotopies.
Mike Shulman <span class="citation" data-cites="shulman_cohesion">(<a
href="#ref-shulman_cohesion" role="doc-biblioref">Shulman,
2017</a>)</span> and others have developed and extended a system of
functions and higher inductive types that act as <em>modal
operators</em> inside HoTT, with a corresponding topos-theoretic
interpretation that extends ideas of Lawvere known as <em>cohesion</em>.
One of the higher inductive types is called <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/shape+modality"><em>shape</em></a>
and when this operator is applied to a 0-type such as a manifold the
output is its fundamental <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>-groupoid as a higher type. This
offers a pathway for classical objects to be imported into type theory,
and for us to then define type-theoretic versions of classical
constructions such as bundles and connections.</p>
<p>But the fundamental <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>-groupoid of a space is a
relatively impoverished object, since paths that are homotopic are made
equal. Connections that agree on homotopy-equivalent paths are called
<em>flat</em> and are so special that we cannot build gauge theory just
with them. We seek a fuller picture of connections.</p>
<h2 id="combinatorial-manifolds">Combinatorial manifolds</h2>
<p>Per Hatcher <span class="citation" data-cites="hatcher_at">(<a
href="#ref-hatcher_at" role="doc-biblioref">Hatcher, 2002</a>)</span> a
<em>CW complex</em> is a space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
constructed through the following recursive procedure. Start with a set
<span class="math inline">\(X_0\)</span>, the 0-cells of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Then inductively form the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-skeleton from the <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>-skeleton by attaching a set of disks
via attaching maps of the boundary spheres. If <span
class="math inline">\(I_{n}\)</span> is the indexing set at stage <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, this means forming the pushout <span
class="math display">\[\begin{CD}
\coprod_{I_n} S^{n-1} @&gt;\mathrm{attach}&gt;&gt; X_{n-1} \\
@V\mathrm{incl}VV @VVV \\
\coprod_{I_n} D^{n} @&gt;\phi_{I_n}&gt;&gt; X_{n}
\end{CD}
\]</span> We require each map in the set <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_{I_n}\)</span> to be a homeomorphism on the
interior of the disk. We will assume we stop at a finite dimension. We
will be left with maps <span class="math inline">\(X_0\hookrightarrow
X_1\hookrightarrow\cdots\hookrightarrow X_n\)</span> for some finite
dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>What topological manifolds are equivalent to a CW complex? The answer
is the composition of a few results summarized <a
href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/201944/topological-n-manifolds-have-the-homotopy-type-of-n-dimensional-cw-complexes">by
Allen Hatcher</a> (citing <span class="citation"
data-cites="kirby_siebenmann">(<a href="#ref-kirby_siebenmann"
role="doc-biblioref">Kirby &amp; Siebenmann, 1977</a>)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="freedman_quinn">(<a
href="#ref-freedman_quinn" role="doc-biblioref">Freedman &amp; Quinn,
1990</a>)</span>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every topological manifold has a handlebody structure except in
dimension 4, where a 4-manifold has a handlebody structure if and only
if it is smoothable. This is a theorem on page 136 of Freedman and
Quinn’s book “Topology of 4-Manifolds”, with a reference given to the
Kirby-Siebenmann book for the higher-dimensional case. It is then an
elementary fact that an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-manifold
with a handlebody structure is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with
one <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cell for each <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-handle, so in particular there are no
cells of dimension greater than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
At least in the compact case a manifold with a handlebody structure is
in fact homeomorphic to a CW complex with <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cells corresponding to <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-handles; see page 107 of
Kirby-Siebenmann. This probably holds in the noncompact case as well,
though I don’t know a reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could we take the data of a classical CW complex and convert it into
a higher inductive type? We could try replacing the pushout with the
homotopy pushout, and we have constructed a type that has <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-cells living in path level <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. But this is not obviously amenable to
defining discrete forms or connections. Why? Because the “bulk” of the
manifold, the top-dimensional cells, have been thrust up to level <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in the type theory.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to approximate a function <span
class="math inline">\(f:X\to \mathbb{R}\)</span> on a manifold with some
sort of sampling or averaging. Start by forming a fine triangulation on
the manifold (i.e. using lots of triangles). To construct a discrete
approximation <span class="math inline">\(f_d\)</span> it seems natural
to assign to each triangle a value that approximates <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in that region, say by taking the
average of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> over the triangle.
What would play the role of the differential <span
class="math inline">\(df\)</span>? It makes sense to look at two
triangles <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> that share an edge <span
class="math inline">\(e_{12}\)</span> and look at the difference <span
class="math inline">\(f_d(t_2)-f_d(t_1)\)</span> and assign that to the
edge <span class="math inline">\(e_{12}\)</span>. This is a
<em>dual</em> edge to the triangulation, and the two vertices that it
joins are <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> considered as single points,
i.e. <em>dual</em> vertices.</p>
<p>In HoTT terms we would like the top-dimensional classical information
to live at level 0 in the type theory, and the connectivity to live at
level 1 and so on. So instead of forming a triangulation or CW structure
for our manifold, we want to form a <em>Čech nerve of a good open
cover</em>. The nLab <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/good+open+cover">states that every
CW complex admits a good open cover</a> because every CW complex is
homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex, which admit good open
covers.<strong>[TODO: try to do better]</strong></p>
<p>So let’s form HITs whose points correspond to the bulk, that is to
open sets in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, so as to capture
combinatorially structures that are samples or averages of their
classical counterparts.</p>
<p>This is calculus without infinitesimals and without tangent spaces.
Paths and higher paths have finite length. There is no de Rham
cohomology, only cellular cohomology.</p>
<p>Consider the surface of a Rubik’s cube as a stand-in for a 2-sphere.
Let’s call the face that has a white center the white face. If the white
face is on top and the green face is facing you, then yellow is on the
bottom, blue is at the back, red is to the right and orange is to the
left. (This works even if the cube is scrambled.) Form an open cover
whose open sets are faces plus a little spillover to the four
neighboring faces. The nerve of this cover is an octahedron with
vertices colored white, green and so on, with edges that correspond to
adjacent faces, and with 2-cells for the 3-way intersections taking
place at the original corners.</p>
<p>(Alternatively, we could form the open cover by taking a neighborhood
of each vertex, e.g. the interiors of all cells of all dimensions that
contain that vertex. In this way the points at level 0 of the nerve are
associated with the vertices of the complex. This will be a dual complex
to the one that works with top-dimensional faces. I’m not currently sure
which approach will be preferable in which applications.)</p>
<p>We can define a non-flat connection on this space, one that captures
the intrinsic curvature of the embedding into 3-dimensional space, in
the following way.</p>
<p>Imagine a closed path on the original cube that starts at the white
center square, moves along the top face and then the red face to the red
center square, then comes around to the front green square, then back up
to the white north pole. This path traverses three faces. In the dual
octahedron this path picks out the white-red edge, then the red-green
edge, then green-white. So it’s also a closed path in the dual space. We
will assign to this curve a point in <span
class="math inline">\(SO(2)\)</span>, which is the structure group of
the tangent bundle of the sphere. In particular we assign the value
“clockwise rotation by 90 degrees”. That’s what happens to an imaginary
tangent vector as it is transported around this curve. I haven’t defined
tangent vectors, but I don’t need to, they are just to help us
understand why we made this choice of group element.</p>
<p>Classically a connection is usually defined to be a 1-form with
values in the Lie algebra of the structure group. That’s just the
infinitesimal version of what we did, which is the assignment of group
elements to paths.</p>

<p>Given a nerve <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the type of
principal <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> bundles over <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the function type <span
class="math inline">\(X\to \mathsf{BAut}_1 S^1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a particular function <span class="math inline">\(f:X\to
\mathsf{BAut}_1 S^1\)</span>, what does this function do at the various
levels of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>? On terms <span
class="math inline">\(x_0:X\)</span> it assigns a particular <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>-torsor <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_0):\mathsf{BAut}_1 S^1\)</span>. On paths
<span class="math inline">\(p:x_1=_X x_2\)</span> it assigns an
isomorphism of torsors <span
class="math inline">\(f(p):f(x_0)=f(x_1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next we will form the total space <span
class="math inline">\((x:X)\times f(x)\)</span> and look at what we know
about <em>dependent paths</em>, also known as <em>pathovers</em>. We
claim that we can lift paths uniquely to dependent paths in a way that
corresponds to a connection on this bundle.</p>
<p>Can this connection be curved, or is it necessarily flat? It can be
curved! Consider a path in the Rubik’s cube nerve (the octahedron)
starting from the top (white) point (which stands in for the whole white
face of the cube) and moving to the red point, then green, then back to
the white point. Applying <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to this
loop gives an automorphism of the torsor <span
class="math inline">\(f(white)\)</span>. This is a group element of the
central type <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> which we will name
<span class="math inline">\(f(wrgw)\)</span>. This can be a non-identity
element. But since this path bounds a 2-cell <span
class="math inline">\(wrg\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there is a 2-path from this loop to
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{refl}_w\)</span>. Is there a path
from <span class="math inline">\(f(wrgw)\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(1_{S^1}\)</span>? Yes, the central type <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> is connected so there are various
paths we could choose, which differ by winding number. The 2-face will
map to this path. <strong>[TODO: detail the 2-type structure of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}_1 S^1\)</span>]</strong></p>
<p>The lifting of paths is a connection, and the assignment of paths
<span class="math inline">\(1=_{S^1}g\)</span> to 2-cells is curvature.
Classically these are defined infinitesimally as a 1-form and a 2-form,
so it’s all making sense.</p>
<p>If the map is more than just “the bundle” and contains the data of a
curved connection automatically, can we recover the underlying bundle
without its connection?</p>
<p>Classically we have that hiccup that connections aren’t actually
1-forms, they are points in an affine space modeled on 1-forms. But
curvature is an honest 2-form. Can we detect that hiccup here? Yes, in
this context we made an arbitrary choice when we assigned <span
class="math inline">\(f(white)\)</span>. We could slide the whole image
of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> around in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}_1 S^1\)</span> and get an equivalent
bundle and connection. But no matter where we place the octahedron, the
curvature assignment is the same, because the choices of torsors cancel
out. But do they entirely? If you read classical material very carefully
you might notice fine print like this: curvature is defined only up to
conjugation! We could have told you that, since all the points in a
space of torsors have the same group as the loop space at that point,
but they are conjugate to each other. In fact they are merely conjugate,
as there are many conjugations (paths between two points) we can choose.
A whole torsor’s worth!</p>

<p>Example HITs: spheres, RPn (RP2 is in Brunerie at al “Synthetic
integral coho”), tori</p>
<p>Cohen Theorem 2.24 p. 73: Complex line bundles over CPn are the
integers, and for n&gt;=0 the bundle is the n-fold tensor power of the
universal line bundle.</p>
<p>Cohen Theorem 2.25: The only nontriv real line bundle over RPn is the
canonical line bundle.</p>
<p>Cohen Theorem 2.27: A bundle has a nontriv section iff the
classifying map factor through one dimension lower.</p>
<p>Covering spaces have a unique connection and it’s flat.</p>
<p>A characteristic class is a natural transformation between the
functor PrinG and the functor H^*.</p>
<p>The first Chern class is a complete invariant of complex line
bundles. The first S-W class is a complete invariant of real line
bundles.</p>
<p>c1 is zero iff the bundle has an SU(n) structure. w1 is zero iff the
bundle has an SO(n) structure.</p>
<p>The cohomology of BU(n) is a polynomial algebra on n generators over
Z with ci in H^2i, and similarly for BO(n) over Z2 with wi in H^i.</p>

<h2 id="torus-groups">Torus groups</h2>
<p>We can get partway towards a theory of principal bundles over
arbitrary Lie groups by using the <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/splitting+principle">maximal
torus</a> (aka “splitting principle”).</p>
<p>This theory is specific to compact Lie groups, which have a theory
relating the group to its maximal torus plus a Weyl group. All maximal
tori are conjugate to each other. The maximal torus of <span
class="math inline">\(U(n)\)</span> is the diagonal subgroup which is
<span class="math inline">\(U(1)^n\)</span>. Every element of a compact
Lie group is conjugate to an element of the maximal torus.</p>
