show this by focusing on combinatorial manifolds, which are discrete in

<blockquote>
<p>"It is always ourselves we work on, whether we realize it or not.
There is no other work to be done in the world." — Stephen Talbott,

</blockquote>
<p>The observation that sparks the following discussion is this: if we
can manage to reformulate differential geometry in discrete terms (i.e.
finite, without infinitesimals) then we may also be able to construct it
synthetically in homotopy type theory (HoTT). Furthermore, if we do
capture geometry in HoTT then there’s a chance that it can become
clearer and smaller. We would then have new tools, a new audience, and a
new program to (re)explore geometry, gauge theory, low dimensional
topology, and mathematical physics.</p>
<p>Applied mathematicians and computer scientists have been developing
discrete differential geometry (DDG) for many years. The 2003 Ph.D.
thesis of Anil Hirani <span class="citation" data-cites="hiranidec"> (<a
href="#ref-hiranidec" role="doc-biblioref">Hirani, 2003</a>)</span> (see
also the multi-author follow-up <span class="citation"
data-cites="desbrundec"> (<a href="#ref-desbrundec"
role="doc-biblioref">Desbrun <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>)</span>) defines
finite versions of vector fields, differential forms, the wedge product,
the Hodge star, and several differential operators (exterior derivative,
div, grad, curl, Laplace-Beltrami, Lie derivative). Hirani and others
cite Whitney’s 1957 book <em>Geometric Integration Theory</em><span
class="citation" data-cites="whitney1957"> (<a href="#ref-whitney1957"
role="doc-biblioref">Whitney, 1957</a>)</span> which develops a theory
of cochains by integrating smooth forms over chains. In 2004 Melvil
Leok, Jerrold Marsden, and Alan Weinstein <span class="citation"
data-cites="leok"> (<a href="#ref-leok" role="doc-biblioref">Leok <em>et
al.</em>, 2005</a>)</span> defined discrete connections on principal
bundles. This is probably the work most spiritually similar to this
paper. The motivation for the above constructions was applied
mathematics: modeling the differential equations of mechanics and fluid
mechanics with the so-called “finite element” methods. The theory has
been adopted and extended by the computer graphics community as well
(see Keenan Crane’s course notes <span class="citation"
data-cites="crane_ddg"> (<a href="#ref-crane_ddg"
role="doc-biblioref">Crane <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>)</span> for a
gentle survey).</p>
<p>The applied category theory community has begun to develop category
theoretic foundations and software libraries to increase the reusability
and compositionality of finite element methods in science and
engineering problems. See for example recent work to bring discrete
exterior calculus into the AlgebraicJulia library <span class="citation"

<p>For these classically-minded applied mathematicians DDG is defined on
combinatorial manifolds such as simplicial complexes or polytopes, of
any finite dimension. The 0-cells play the role of points, the 1-cells
are path segments, and so on. They define <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-forms as functions on the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional faces of the manifold into
the real numbers, which is then extended by linearity to arbitrary <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-chains. Exterior differentiation is
defined by Stokes theorem (which is no longer a theorem in this
setting), by which we mean the following.</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>. <em>(Exterior derivative in DDG.) Let
<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> be an <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>-form on a combinatorial manifold
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> be an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-face of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span> be the boundary operator on
faces. The exterior derivative <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is
defined by <span class="math display">\[d\omega(\Omega) =
\omega(\partial\Omega).\]</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>At this point a study of DDG would move into chain complexes, where
the forms of different dimensions are combined through the grading.
Grassman algebras would be introduced, to convey the dependence of forms
on orientation. The Leibniz rule (product rule) would be explored.
Defining connections and curvature require constructing a codomain that
is group-like and then creating more definitions about transport and
holonomy. At that point major theorems like Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Weil
would be available to prove.</p>
<p>We will take a different path. We will not define forms, complexes,
or Grassman algebras at all. We will view ordinary HoTT functions out of
a type as <em>synthetic discrete differential forms</em>. The codomain
will be a central H-space, which combines the features of the real
numbers (in that functions can be pointwise multiplied) and classifying
spaces of groups (so that maps into the H-space can classify bundles).
We will then merely <em>observe</em> the emergence of various aspects of
geometry.</p>
<p>We won’t be able to answer every question, so eventually we will stop
and point to future directions.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="central-h-spaces"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Central H-spaces</h1>
<p>Central H-spaces are the classifying spaces for principal bundles on
abelian groups. We won’t be able to access the full theory for
nonabelian groups just yet, but we hope that the theory of maximal tori
and weights might bring even those within reach of the central H-space
paradigm.</p>
<p>We will rely on the lovely paper by Buchholtz, Christensen, Flaten
and Rijke <span class="citation" data-cites="buchholtz2023central"> (<a

<h1 data-number="3" id="classifying-maps-contain-connections"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Classifying maps contain

<p>The DDG philosophy tells us to look at HITs that are polytope-like. A
polytope <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will have finitely many
0-dimesional (point) constructors <span
class="math inline">\(\{m_0^i\}\)</span>, finitely many 1-dimesnional
constructors <span
class="math inline">\(\{m_1^{ij}:m_0^i=m_0^j\}\)</span>, and so on. Type
families <span class="math inline">\(f:M\to \mathcal{U}\)</span> on this
type specify where each of thee constructors is sent. In DDG parlance,
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> restricted to the 0-dimensional
constructors of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a 0-form and
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> restricted to the 1-dimensional
constructors (whatever that means in HoTT) is a 1-form, and so on.</p>
<p>A principal <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> bundle is a
family of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> torsors and so we
will be focusing on the function type <span class="math inline">\(M\to
\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span>. The claim is that <span
class="math inline">\(M\to \mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> contains more
than just all the principal <span
class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>-bundles: it also contains all the
connections on all the bundles. Given a term <span
class="math inline">\(f:M\to \mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> the bundle is
the 0-dimensional part of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and the
connection is the 1-dimensional part. Every connection is present, both
curved and flat, because we have complete freedom to specify the images
of the paths.</p>
<p>Classically, curvature is a property of the connection. It is
computed either on infinitesimal loops, or on the infinitesimal surface
bounded by the loop. In fact it is “the derivative of the connection”
morally speaking. Getting into the details would wreck the simplicity
we’re going for<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. We will look for curvature by
examining <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on 1-dimensional loops.
If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is at least a 2-type and if we
want to claim that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> classifies a
bundle with connection, then we will be required to map the 2-faces of
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (the 2-dimesional constructors)
to a path from the image of a bounding loop to <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathsf{refl}}\)</span>. So at
dimension 2 we will impose that constraint. Since <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span> is 2-truncated,
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> factors through the truncation
map <span class="math inline">\(M\to||M||_2\)</span> and so that’s the
top dimension.</p>

class="header-section-number">4</span> Why this is geometry</h1>
<p>How can we double check that we are describing the intended theory of
geometry? In this section we will enumerate a wishlist of facts that we
believe characterize the subject, and then provide evidence for
them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Connections can be described as an infinitesimal splitting of a
bundle into horizontal and vertical components.</p></li>
<li><p>Differentials and directional derivatives satisfy the Leibniz
(product) rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Principal bundles with connection in the case of 0-truncated
discrete groups recaptulates the theory of covering spaces, and covering
spaces have a flat connection.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a notion of <em>tensorial</em> that holds for forms but
not for connections.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds, relating the curvature of a
2-manifold to the Euler characteristic.</p></li>
<li><p>More generally, characteristic classes of bundles can be computed
using a connection (Chern-Weil theory).</p></li>
<li><p>The space of all connections on a fixed bundle is a contractible
space on which the group of <em>based gauge transformations</em> (bundle
automorphisms that are the identity on one selected fiber) acts
freely.</p></li>
<li><p>The homotopy types of manifolds we care about have combinatorial
presentations, and the real-cohesive shape modal operator maps between
them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other questions we might explore:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Where is orientation in this story? Can we compute any examples
of Stiefel-Whitney classes?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we define the Hopf bundle?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is the Grassmannian structure of wedge product?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="connections-as-splittings"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Connections as splittings</h2>
<p>The classical story goes like this.</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 4</strong>. <em>The <em>vertical bundle</em> <span
class="math inline">\(VP\)</span> of a principal bundle <span
class="math inline">\(\pi:P\to B\)</span> with Lie group <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the kernel of the derivative <span
class="math inline">\(T\pi:TP\to TB\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(VP\)</span> can be visualized as the
collection of tangent vectors that point along the fibers. It should be
clear that the group <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Aut}P\)</span>
acts on <span class="math inline">\(VP\)</span>: an automorphism <span
class="math inline">\(\phi:P\to P\)</span> sends <span
class="math inline">\(V_pP\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\phi(p)}P\)</span>, where of course <span
class="math inline">\(\pi(p)=\pi(\phi(p))\)</span>.</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 5</strong>. <em>An <em>Ehresmann connection</em>
on a principal bundle <span class="math inline">\(\pi:P\to B\)</span>
with Lie group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a splitting
<span class="math inline">\(TP=VP\oplus HP\)</span> at every point of
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> into vertical and “horizontal”
subspaces, which is preserved by the action of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Aut}P\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Being preserved by the action of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Aut}P\)</span> means that the
complementary horizontal subspaces in a given fiber of <span
class="math inline">\(\pi:P\to B\)</span> are determined by the
splitting at any single point in the fiber. The action of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on this fiber can then push the
splitting around to all the other points.</p>
<p>The motivation for this definition is that we now have an isomorphism
<span class="math inline">\(T_p\pi:H_pP\to T_{\pi(p)}B\)</span> between
each horizontal space and the tangent space below it in <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This means that given a tangent vector
at <span class="math inline">\(b:B\)</span> and a point <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(b)\)</span> we can uniquely lift the
tangent vector to a horizontal vector at <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We can also lift vector fields and
paths in this way. To lift a path <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma:[0,1]\to B\)</span> you must specify a lift
for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0)\)</span> and then lift the
tangent vectors of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and prove
that you can integrate the lift of that vector field upstairs in <span
class="math inline">\(HP\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then, armed with the lifting of paths one immediately obtains
isomorphisms between the fibers of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. So the Ehresmann connection, the
lifting of paths, and transport isomorphisms between fibers are all
recapitulations of the structure that the connection adds to the
bundle.</p>
<p>Moving now to HoTT, fix a type <span
class="math inline">\(B:\mathcal{U}\)</span> and a type family <span
class="math inline">\(f:B\to\mathcal{U}\)</span>. Path induction gives
us the transport isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{p:x=_B
y}\mathrm{tr}(p):f(x)=f(y)\)</span>. We can use this to define a type of
<em>dependent paths</em>, also called <em>pathovers</em> or <em>paths
over</em> a given path.</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p><strong>Definition 6</strong>. <em>With the above context and points
<span class="math inline">\(a:f(x), b:f(y)\)</span> the type of
<em>dependent paths over <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></em>

<span class="math display">\[a\xrightarrow[{p}]{=}b.\]</span> By
induction we can assume <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathsf{refl}}_a\)</span> in which
case <span class="math inline">\(a\xrightarrow[{p}]{=}b\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(a=_{f(x)}a\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>See <span class="citation" data-cites="Symmetry"> (<a
href="#ref-Symmetry" role="doc-biblioref">Bezem <em>et al.</em>,
2023</a>)</span> for more discussion of dependent paths (where they use
the term “path over”), including composition, and associativity
thereof.</p>
<p>We recall now the identity type of sigma types:</p>
<div class="mythm">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>. <em>(HoTT book Theorem 2.7.2 <span
class="citation" data-cites="hottbook"> (<a href="#ref-hottbook"

<span class="math inline">\(f:B\to \mathcal{U}\)</span> is a type family
and <span class="math inline">\(w,w&#39;:\sum_{x:B}f(x)\)</span> then
there is an equivalence <span class="math display">\[(w=w&#39;)\simeq
\sum_{p:\ensuremath{\mathrm{pr}}_1(w)=_B\ensuremath{\mathrm{pr}}_1(w&#39;)}
\left[\mathrm{tr}(p)(\ensuremath{\mathrm{pr}}_2(w))\right] =
\ensuremath{\mathrm{pr}}_2(w&#39;).\]</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>In particular, given <span class="math inline">\(p:x=_B y\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(w:f(x)\)</span> we have <span
class="math inline">\(w\xrightarrow[{p}]{=}tr(p)(w)\simeq
tr(p)(w)=_{f(y)}tr(p)(w)\)</span> which has the term <span
class="math inline">\(\ensuremath{\mathsf{refl}}\)</span> which we can
call “the horizontal lift of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
starting at <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.” And so in HoTT we
can see the equivalence of transport and lifting of paths into
horizontal and vertical components.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="the-leibniz-product-rule"><span

<p>We can recognize the process of using whiskering to form horizontal
composition in the Leibniz rule.</p>
<p>Quick aside: moving from infinitesimal calculus to finite groupoid
algebra actually involves two changes. The first is the change from
vectors to paths, forms to functions and so on. But it’s also the case
that tangent vectors have just the one basepoint, whereas paths have two
endpoints. You can see this play out in this example, where <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a&#39;\)</span> were distinct points (and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span

<p>The horizontal composition we build lives entirely in <span

<h2 data-number="4.4" id="tensoriality"><span

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> be an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-form on a smooth manifold <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. We are encouraged to think of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> as a function that takes <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vector fields as input and returns a
smooth function. Denoting by <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma
TB\)</span> the type of vector fields, this gives <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha:(\Gamma TB)^n\to (B\to
\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}})\)</span>. If this seems so natural as to be
confusing, remember that forms are usually defined as sections of the
exterior power of the cotangent bundle, and so we are moving between
viewing a form as a section of a bundle, or as a function on tuples of
vector fields.</p>
<p>An <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-form viewed this way has
the property that it is linear over <span
class="math inline">\(B\to\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> in every
component, i.e. if <span class="math inline">\(f_1, \ldots,
f_n:B\to\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> then <span

f_n\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_n).\]</span> We also say that <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is <em>tensorial</em> in every
argument. A function on vector fields is tensorial just when it’s linear
over the action of smooth functions on vector fields. Examples include
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-forms and metrics (which are
symmetric instead of being antisymmetric like forms).</p>
<p>But what about connections and curvature?</p>
<h2 data-number="4.5" id="gauge-transformations"><span
class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Gauge transformations</h2>
<p>A <em>gauge transformation</em> is a term inherited from physics.
It’s an automorphism of a principal bundle <span
class="math inline">\(P\to M\)</span>, meaning a homeomorphism of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that commutes with the projection to
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and so acts on each fiber. It is
further required to be equivariant under the action of the group <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and so it’s very similar to the act of
multiplying each fiber by a continuously varying element of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>In HoTT if the bundle is classified by <span
class="math inline">\(f:M\to \mathcal{U}\)</span> then an automorphism
is a homotopy <span class="math inline">\(f\sim f\)</span> and the group
of gauge transformations is the loop space <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_f(M\to \mathcal{U})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recall that torsors have a physical interpretation as a quantity
without a specified unit, such as mass, length, or time. When we choose
a base point in a torsor it becomes the standard torsor <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acting on itself (for example, the
additive real numbers). A physicist is looking for properties or laws
that are independent of such a choice. In the 20th century physicists
further wondered about choices of units that vary from point to point,
and began searching for laws that are invariant under this much larger
space of transformations. And so they and we are led to explore
quotienting by the action of the group of gauge transformations, and in
particular the space of connections “mod gauge.” In this scenario the
base manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is spacetime, and a
gauge transformation is a smoothly varying choice of gauge (units) at
each point.</p>
<p>Gauge transformations act on connections. When we view connections as
infinitesimal splittings of <span class="math inline">\(TP\)</span> into
vertical and horizontal sub-bundles, a gauge transformation that is
constant in the neighborhood of a point will not change the splitting,
it will just shift the fiber rigidly along itself, but one that is
changing rapidly near a point will tilt the horizontal subspaces. So
there are two effects: the effect of sliding along the fiber, and the
effect of the rate of change of the gauge transformation. In classical
geometry you’ll see formulas like this:</p>
<div class="mythm">
<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong>. <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(P\to
M\)</span> be a principal bundle and <span
class="math inline">\(A\in\Omega^1(M,\mathfrak{g})\)</span> a connection
1-form on <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Suppose that <span
class="math inline">\(f\in \mathscr{G}(P)\)</span> is a bundle
automorphism. Then <span class="math inline">\(f^*A\)</span> is a
connection 1-form and in a neighborhood <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of a point <span
class="math inline">\(x\in M\)</span> we can write <span

class="math inline">\(f_U(x)\in G\)</span> is a group element
multiplying the fiber at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and
then we have <span
class="math display">\[f^*A=\mathrm{Ad}_{f_U(x)^{-1}}\circ A +
f_U^*(\mu_G)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_G:\Omega^1(G,\mathfrak{g})\)</span> is the
Maurer-Cartan form on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This theorem is a combination of Theorems 5.2.2 and 5.4.4 in the
excellent recent book on gauge theory for mathematicians interested in
physics by Mark Hamilton<span class="citation"
data-cites="hamilton2017"> (<a href="#ref-hamilton2017"
role="doc-biblioref">Hamilton, 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s not so important to fully understand this formula because we
will re-explain it in HoTT terms in a moment. But notice that <span
class="math inline">\(f^*A\)</span> (the action of the gauge
transformation on the connection 1-form) has contributions from two
terms (both of which are vertical — connections always map onto the
vertical bundle). The first is the adjoint action at the specific point
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. This is always what we expect
when we shift the base point in a torsor. The second term involves the
Maurer-Cartan form, which is the derivative of subtraction in the group.
It takes tangent vectors at <span class="math inline">\(g:G\)</span> to
a tangent vector at the identity (the Lie algebra, denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span>) by differentiating the
action of multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(g^-1\)</span>.
If we think in terms of finite-length paths, then imagine a path <span
class="math inline">\(p:g=g&#39;\)</span> and the function <span
class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\cdot -\)</span> will act on the path to
give a path <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\cdot p:e=g&#39;\cdot
g^{-1}\)</span> that starts at the identity. So the Maurer-Cartan form
shifts paths to start at the identity by subtracting off the start
point. So this Maurer-Cartan term is recording the contribution from the
gauge transformation <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that comes
from the rapidity of change from point to point. This term will be large
when <span class="math inline">\(f_U\)</span> has a large
derivative.</p>
<p>In HoTT the connection’s parallel transport is visible as the
transport function, and the horizontal-vertical splitting is visible in
the decomposition of paths in the sigma type (total space) into pairs of
paths. What is the effect of applying a homotopy <span

<h2 data-number="4.6"
id="characteristic-classes-and-chern-weil-theory"><span
class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Characteristic classes and
Chern-Weil theory</h2>
<p>(I am trying to decide whether this can be in a follow-up paper. Here
is a sketch.)</p>
<p>Chern-Weil “theory” is actually a map, from the space of connections
on the bundle <span class="math inline">\(\pi:P\to B\)</span> to the
cohomology ring of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, plus the
claim that these are the characteristic classes for the bundle. (cite
Freed-Hopkins<span class="citation" data-cites="freed2013chernweil"> (<a
href="#ref-freed2013chernweil" role="doc-biblioref">Freed &amp; Hopkins,
2013</a>)</span>)</p>
<p>In HoTT this theorem will disappear, in two steps. Step 1 is to
replace bundles by classifying maps to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\)</span>, and cohomology
classes by classifying maps to <span
class="math inline">\(K(G,n)\)</span>s. The characteristic classes of a
bundle are then just the composition of the two classifying maps. In
particular the first Chern class would be given by composing the
bundle-classifying map with the identity map <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BAut}_1(S^1)\simeq
K(\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}},2)\)</span>!</p>
<p>Step 2 is the work of the previous sections, noting that in HoTT maps
contain connections, and so inside the characteristic classes, defined
by maps into a classifying space, we can see conenctions and curvature.
In the case of the Chern class we can see that the curvature “is” the
characteristic class, since it is picked out by the map to <span
class="math inline">\(K(\ensuremath{\mathbb{Z}},2)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Every topological manifold has a handlebody structure except in

if it is smoothable. This is a theorem on page 136 of Freedman and
Quinn’s book "Topology of 4-Manifolds", with a reference given to the
Kirby-Siebenmann book for the higher-dimensional case. It is then an
elementary fact that an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-manifold
with a handlebody structure is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with
one <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cell for each <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-handle, so in particular there are no
cells of dimension greater than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
At least in the compact case a manifold with a handlebody structure is
in fact homeomorphic to a CW complex with <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cells corresponding to <span

<p>The classical 2-sphere embedded in <span

<ol>
<li><p>The set of vertices <span class="math inline">\(\{w, y, b, g, r,
