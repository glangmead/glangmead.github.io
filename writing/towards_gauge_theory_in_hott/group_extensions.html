<p>One way of thinking about bringing smooth manifolds into this group

Chern-Weil theory<span class="citation"
data-cites="freed2013chernweil">(Freed and Hopkins 2013)</span> lie at
the intersection of mathematics and physics. The theory of general
relativity is expressed as formulas relating the curvature of spacetime
to the distribution of energy and matter. The standard model of particle
physics is expressed as a collection of principal bundles and associated
vector bundles, sections of which represent the fields of matter and
forces. And in the latter decades of the 20th century the tools of the
standard model were applied back into mathematics to make discoveries
about the geometry of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds<span
class="citation" data-cites="scorpan_wild_2005">(Scorpan

<p>Homotopy type theory<span class="citation"
data-cites="hottbook">(Univalent Foundations Program 2013)</span> seems
at first like it’s from a different universe entirely. It grew out of
questions of a foundational nature inside mathematics and computer
science. It brings a synthetic stance, where we are invited to stop
thinking of mathematical objects as sets with structure, and instead to
assemble the objects into higher categories with collective properties
like being locally cartesian closed, or having homotopical model
structures. Such categories have internal languages, which are syntactic
structures much like programming languages, which allow us to reason
about the objects in a generic way.</p>
<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
<p>Group theory including the theory of higher groups is built directly
into HoTT, via the identity types. A thorough introductory treatment of
group theory that adopts this philosophy can be found in the book
<em>Symmetry</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Symmetry">(Bezem et
al. 2023)</span>. We will build on this synthetic framework to explore
gauge theory. But it’s important to be clear that this is a choice, and
there is an alternate approach. Namely we could define a group to be a
type together with some extra structure: an identity, a multiplication
operation, and an inverse operation, satisfying some properties. We
would do the same for higher groups, and we’d prove an equivalence
between the type of higher groups and the type of pointed, connected
types. Such a project has been undertaken in the context of higher topos
theory, but at the time of this writing it hasn’t been done inside HoTT.
We certainly can define the type of groups which are sets, and prove
that this type of 0-groups is equivalent to connected 1-types, and this
is done in <em>Symmetry</em>. But in the case of higher groups we only
have one definition: pointed connected types. This happens to be a
lovely theory, and so we’ll be glad to run with that.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>. A (higher) group is a pointed 1-type
<span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> with basepoint <span
class="math inline">\(*\)</span>, which is connected, i.e. that we have
a term of the type <span
class="math inline">\((a:BG)\to||*=a||_{-1}\)</span>. We denote the type
<span class="math inline">\(*=*\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and so if we have a particular group
in mind then we think of that group as being installed as the identity
type of the basepoint in a type we call <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>.</p>
<p>This notation is fairly confusing, since we have stated that <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> is a group, but that <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the group we really mean. Let’s see
how much trouble it ends up causing.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a
pointed, connected 1-type with basepoint <span
class="math inline">\(*\)</span>,<span
class="math inline">\(x:X\)</span> is any term, and <span
class="math inline">\(p:*=x\)</span> any term, then the sets <span
class="math inline">\(*=*\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(*=x\)</span> are isomorphic. Furthermore, <span
class="math inline">\(*=*\)</span> acts on <span
class="math inline">\(*=x\)</span> freely and transitively, by
concatenation.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong> For the first statement, define <span
class="math inline">\(-\cdot p:*=*\to *=x\)</span>, by concatenating
with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(-\cdot p^{-1}:*=x\to *=*\)</span> is a two-sided
inverse. For the second statement, if <span
class="math inline">\(g:*=*\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(g\cdot p:*=x\)</span>, giving an action.
Transitivity can be seen by solving the equation <span
class="math inline">\(q = g\cdot p\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> by concatenating both sides by <span
class="math inline">\(p^{-1}\)</span> on the right. Freeness can be seen
by observing that <span class="math inline">\(g\cdot p = h\cdot
p\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(g=h\)</span>.</p>
<p>So identity types with unequal endpoints like <span
class="math inline">\(*=x\)</span> are torsors, and it’s noteworthy to
find torsors appearing to close to the foundations of HoTT.</p>
<h3 id="group-actions">Group actions</h3>
<p>Given any pointed type <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with
basepoint <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> we can form the type
<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}_x(X)\)</span> by taking the
connected component of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. If we
consider the terms of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to be at
type-theoretic level 0, then <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Aut}_x\)</span> brings one of the identity
types from level 1 down to level 0 to look at it on its own. Then the B
can be thought of as reinstalling the identity type at level 1 of the
new type, which contains only the connected component of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. When we do this, though, we don’t
forget the identity types of all the other terms in the connected
component. That’s why there really isn’t a true B operator, just a
notation that is meant to evoke the classical idea of a classifying
space, since as we’ll see we really have captured that idea.</p>
<p>A homomorphism of groups is a pointed map <span
class="math inline">\(f:BG\to X\)</span>. The rules of type theory will
ensure that this map contains a map between the identity types inside
the types, forming a group homomorphism in the usual sense. We can think
of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acting on <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> since the homomorphism is <span
class="math inline">\(*=*\to x=x\)</span>. If we take <span
class="math inline">\(X=\mathcal{U}\)</span> to be the universe, and if
<span class="math inline">\(f(*)=H\)</span>, then we can think of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acting on the type <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="equivariant-maps">Equivariant maps</h3>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(BG\xrightarrow[]{r_X} \mathsf{BAut}_x
X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(BG\xrightarrow[]{r_Y}
\mathsf{BAut}_y Y\)</span> are two group actions</p>
<h2 id="principal-bundles">Principal bundles</h2>
<h3 id="bundles-over-bg">Bundles over <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span></h3>
<p>Pointed connected types <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> come
with three built-in type families by choosing identity types with
different endpoints. There’s <span
class="math inline">\(LG:=(a:BG)\times a=a\)</span> which is at each
point the group of self-identifications of that point. There’s <span
class="math inline">\(EG:=(a:BG)\times *=a\)</span> which aren’t groups,
but which are similar to the self-identifications, and in fact are
torsors over <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>! At each point <span
class="math inline">\(a:BG\)</span> we can concatenate a term of <span
class="math inline">\(EG(a)\)</span> with a term of <span
class="math inline">\(LG(a)\)</span> by concatenating the latter to the
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> endpoint of <span
class="math inline">\(EG(a)\)</span>. And lastly there’s the
non-dependent type <span class="math inline">\(BG\times G\)</span> which
I’m mentioning because we can also concatenate a term of <span
class="math inline">\(EG(a)\)</span> with a term of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, by attaching it to the <span
class="math inline">\(*\)</span> endpoint.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> is contractible (Lemma 3.11.8
of The HoTT Book). It’s worth reflecting for a moment on the fact that
<span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> is contractible but <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> is not. After all, <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> is connected and so all its terms are
equal to the base point via some path. But we don’t select any specific
paths as part of the data. Forming <span
class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> is simply to install all the solutions
to this missing data as the fibers of a bundle over <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>.</p>
<p>Example: for <span class="math inline">\(G=\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}^n,
\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> provide <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(LG\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="mapping-into-bg">Mapping into <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span></h3>
<p>Pulling back <span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> via a map <span
class="math inline">\(X\to BG\)</span> deserves to be called a principal
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundle over <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and pulling back <span
class="math inline">\(LG\)</span> via the same map deserves to be called
a gauge transformation.</p>
<p>In HoTT given a map <span class="math inline">\(f:A\to B\)</span> and
a type family <span class="math inline">\(P:B\to \mathcal{U}\)</span> we
can form the following square and it will commute and be a pullback:</p>

<p>If we have an arbitrary type <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(f:X\to BG\)</span> then we can pull back
<span class="math inline">\(EG\)</span> this way:</p>

<p>or we can pull back <span class="math inline">\(LG\)</span>:</p>

<p>Let’s name these pullbacks <span class="math inline">\(E_fX\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(L_fX\)</span> respectively. We include
the classifying map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in the
notation but maybe we’ll leave it out sometimes. Terms of <span
class="math inline">\(E_fX\)</span> are a pair <span
class="math inline">\((x, p)\)</span>: a term of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and a term of the torsor <span
class="math inline">\(*=f(x)\)</span>. Terms of <span
class="math inline">\(L_fX\)</span> are also a pair <span
class="math inline">\((x, l)\)</span>: a term of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and a term of the loop space <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(x)\)</span>. We can form <span
class="math inline">\((x, p\cdot l)\)</span> and in fact we can act on
all of <span class="math inline">\(E_fX\)</span> with a section of <span
class="math inline">\(L_fX\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{G}X:=((x,l):L_fX)\to E_fX\to
E_fX\]</span> which acts fiberwise by concatenating <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> to any torsor.</p>
<p>The bundle <span class="math inline">\(E_fX\)</span> would
classically be called something like <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, a principal bundle with gauge group
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. The bundle <span
class="math inline">\(L_fX\)</span> would then be referred to as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Ad}P\)</span>. Why is that?</p>

class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> classifies bundles, not just

<p>The classical theorems take the form: taking the pullback of <span

homotopy classes of maps <span class="math inline">\(f:X\to BG\)</span>
and equivalence classes of principal <span

<p>Extensions of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> are equivalent to maps <span
class="math inline">\(\mathscr{C}:X\to \mathsf{BAut}BG\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s look in detail at <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}BG\)</span>. First of all it’s a
2-type. Its terms are “<span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> clones”.
The identity types are equivalences between <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> clones. Those equivalences have
identity types as well, which are homotopies between equivalences
between <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> clones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile each of the fibers <span
class="math inline">\(\mathscr{C}(x)\)</span> is a <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>-clone. The union of all of these is
the sigma-type <span class="math inline">\((x:X)\times
\mathscr{C}(x)\)</span>. But the 2-type structure of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}BG\)</span> doesn’t apply inside a
term of a <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>-clone, they are
identity types between types, whereas inside <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> and its clones, we have terms, which
are something like individual <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-torsors.</p>
<p>Maybe we should look to the pi-type <span
class="math inline">\((x:X)\to \mathscr{C}(x)\)</span>. This should be
something like a principal bundle, sinc this type is a generalization of
the type <span class="math inline">\(X\to BG\)</span>, which as we know
is supposed to classify principal bundles. In the special case where
<span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{C}\)</span> is the constant map to
<span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>, we indeed would have to
consider the pi-type to have a type of principal bundles.</p>
<p>In the literature on Schreier theory, we can look for clues about how
to proceed. Let’s move away from HoTT for a moment and look at group
extensions from the point of view of groupoids and 2-groupoids, in
classical category theory.</p>

<p>The study of group extensions is about constructing an equivalence
between extensions of a group <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, which is a surjection from the
extension <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and a classifying map <em>out</em> of
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Given the extension, which takes
the form of an exact sequence <span class="math display">\[1\to
G\xrightarrow[]{i} E\xrightarrow[]{p}X\to 1\]</span> how do we construct
a classifying map out of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Baez sketch from <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>: since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a surjection, start by choosing a
set function <span class="math inline">\(s:X\to E\)</span> that is a
section of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This induces a
function <span class="math inline">\(\alpha:X\to \mathsf{Aut}G\)</span>
by taking <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(x)(g)=s(x)g
s(x)^{-1}\)</span>. In general <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is not a homomorphism, but it is
up to a conjugation. If we view groups as 1-element categories and
homomorphisms as functors, then <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a weak functor.</p>
<p>Let’s compare <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(xy)\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha(x)\alpha(y)\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\alpha(xy)(g) = s(xy)gs(xy)^{-1}\]</span> whereas
<span class="math display">\[\alpha(x)(\alpha(y)(g)) =
s(x)[s(y)gs(y)^{-1}]s(x)^{-1}\]</span> which are equal if <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is a homomorphism. But if <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not, we need a “homomorphinator” to
relate these two formulas. The obvious thing to do is to form <span
class="math inline">\(h(x, y) = s(xy)s(x)^{-1}s(y)^{-1}\)</span>.
Conjugating by <span class="math inline">\(h(x,y)\)</span> cancels the
<span class="math inline">\(s(x)s(y)\)</span> factors and replaces them
with <span class="math inline">\(s(xy)\)</span>. So a map that isn’t a
homomorphism can nonetheless behave like one if we have the freedom to
introduce a homomorphinator.</p>
<p>What is weakness when we look at things in HoTT? (My current
candidate: an unpointed map. The homomorphinator would then be a choice
of path that restores pointedness.)</p>
<p>What are conjugations? (My current candidate: changes of
basepoint.)</p>
<p>What is a map that isn’t a homorphism in HoTT but is a homomorphism
up to a 2-morphism? Does this imply that <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> ends up having a natural 2-type
structure? It’s a union of <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>
clones over the base <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and so by
the usual calculations it is only a 1-type.</p>
<p>Can we bring some of the 2-type structure from <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}BG\)</span> into <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> itself? Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a map <span class="math inline">\(f:BG\to BG=BG\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> is an equivalence that
moves the basepoint from <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</li>
<li>a path <span class="math inline">\(p:*=_{BG}a\)</span> can be
concatenated to any other path, providing an automorphism of the space
of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-torsors, sending the torsor
<span class="math inline">\(*=b\)</span> to the torsor <span
class="math inline">\(a=b\)</span> by concatenating all the paths in
<span class="math inline">\(*=b\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This may map the paths in <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(BG=BG\)</span>.</li>
<li>so having a map from <span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> into
<span class="math inline">\(BG=BG\)</span> may let us</li>
</ul>
<p>Tying this together might be the intuition that higher paths are more
and more microscopic structure inside <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>, whereas the types <span
class="math inline">\(BG=_{\mathsf{BAut}BG}BG\)</span> and then <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{id}=_{BG=BG}\mathrm{id}\)</span> seem to
go outward, or maybe more fruitfully, they go inward but inside <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}BG\)</span>. I seem to want to relate
these in a way I haven’t seen, where we can bring more structure inside
<span class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> by looking in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BAut}BG\)</span>.</p>
<p>I believe I can define maps <span class="math inline">\(BG\to
BG=BG\)</span> and from <span class="math inline">\(*=_{BG}a\to
BG=BG\)</span> which utilize the homogeneity of <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span>. Can this be clarified enough to see
how we might introduce 2-paths in <span
class="math inline">\(BG\)</span> which let us translate the Schreier
story from 2-groups to 2-types?</p>
