    <div class="article-style">
      
      I decided recently to embrace my dilettantism. I don&rsquo;t think there have been two consecutive days in my life where I wanted to pursue and learn the same ideas. Now mind you, the complete list of topics is finite and I cycle back eventually.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I grew up assuming that people make their own way in the world. I thought it was up to me to make every decision, plan every move, open every door, and find my own way in my life and career. Only much later did I learn that I was doing it all wrong. Not only is my way much harder, it&rsquo;s also completely miserable to be so isolated. Here&rsquo;s an example. The place where I started making these wrong decisions was in college. I attended my classes, which in some cases were way below my capabilities, and in other cases were way above. Either way, at the end of class, I packed up my things and walked back to my room. I dreamed of being a scientist, just like I had since I was 10 years old. But all I did was go to class, I never spoke with any professors, nor was I ever approached by any. My talents started to appear in my sophomore year, but I was still doing things in this retarded way. Then in my junior year the first consequence of my nihilistic lifestyle happened, and I didn&rsquo;t even really notice it for what it was until years later. I switched my major from Astronomy to Astrophysics, then I added a concentration (minor) in Math, and then I made Math a second major. This all happened within a couple of months. Even these bureaucratic thrashings didn&rsquo;t raise any red flags in any administrators or professors. No one cared. So, I shifted my focus to math, threw away the pile of physics grad school applications I had, and requested a bunch of math ones. I went to graduate school for a year at Stony Brook, then transferred back to Columbia for the rest of my Ph.D., because my then-girlfriend, now-wife, was continuing on from Columbia undergrad to grad school.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Over Thanksgiving, I was complaining about people who crowd forward when boarding a plane, even if their row hasn&rsquo;t been called, so that when it is called, they get on first. And if they can get away with boarding before their row is called, they&rsquo;ll do that too. Someone close to me retorted, &ldquo;competition made the human race what it is today.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t stopped thinking about that remark ever since. Can this person be right? I dearly, dearly hope not. Because all I can think of in reply is, &ldquo;yes, it did make us what we are &ndash; especially the World Wars and the Holocaust.&rdquo;

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;m listening to The Return of the King: The Complete Recordings at work, and I&rsquo;m at the point near the (first) end when Frodo and Sam have just destroyed the ring (with Gollum&rsquo;s unwitting help) and they&rsquo;re escaping the flowing lava by standing on a rock, feeling a relieved. With all the events of the story to back up the scene, I think it&rsquo;s truly moving to see these two regular guys, who together destroyed a great and senseless evil power. I actually see it as a very tragic moment, when two of the world&rsquo;s great forces are being presented to us via the heightened drama of this point in the story: senseless evil/destruction/chaos on the one hand, and the fortitude and perseverance and good of the common person on the other hand. You can ask all sorts of questions at this point, like if the common person is so good, where is all the evil coming from? Why must the most ordinary and good people sustain such injury and sacrifice to ward off the worst effects of the evil?

      Has Masterpiece Theater always just been some British TV show? Lately they&rsquo;ve been showing The Amazing Mrs. Prithcard, which felt like an American TV show that happened to be British. Is it a masterpiece? Did they pick it because they felt it was a masterpiece? Maybe they should rename Masterpiece Theater to &ldquo;Some British TV Show&rdquo;.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2007-09-27-lord-of-the-rings-movie-versus-book/">Lord of the Rings, movie versus book</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      A while back I wanted to read The Lord of the Rings aloud with my wife. We&rsquo;ve read lots of books together this way, and I&rsquo;m a huge LOTR fan, so I really wanted to share it. The problem is it&rsquo;s very long and many people consider lots of it boring. So, I took a clever (if I do say so myself) shortcut! I went through the books and dog-eared ranges of pages where the plot differed from the movies in a way I thought significant or noteworthy. For example, I read the entire chapter &ldquo;The scouring of the shire&rdquo; because this was left out of the movie. I highlighted the differences in Denethor&rsquo;s character as much as I could, as well as Faramir&rsquo;s. Both were substantially diminished in moral quality in the movies.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently heard of a book called The Jasons at the blog of a former colleague, Peter Woit. Since I spent the summer of 2004 doing classified math research for the government, I was very interested to hear of another such group. In a way, the Jasons are a sequel to the very successful Manhattan Project, and there is lots of overlap of personnel. The Jasons came into being in the aftermath of the Soviet launch of Sputnik, in 1960 to be exact.
