      I grew up assuming that people make their own way in the world. I thought it was up to me to make every decision, plan every move, open every door, and find my own way in my life and career. Only much later did I learn that I was doing it all wrong. Not only is my way much harder, it&rsquo;s also completely miserable to be so isolated. Here&rsquo;s an example. The place where I started making these wrong decisions was in college. I attended my classes, which in some cases were way below my capabilities, and in other cases were way above. Either way, at the end of class, I packed up my things and walked back to my room. I dreamed of being a scientist, just like I had since I was 10 years old. But all I did was go to class, I never spoke with any professors, nor was I ever approached by any. My talents started to appear in my sophomore year, but I was still doing things in this retarded way. Then in my junior year the first consequence of my nihilistic lifestyle happened, and I didn&rsquo;t even really notice it for what it was until years later. I switched my major from Astronomy to Astrophysics, then I added a concentration (minor) in Math, and then I made Math a second major. This all happened within a couple of months. Even these bureaucratic thrashings didn&rsquo;t raise any red flags in any administrators or professors. No one cared. So, I shifted my focus to math, threw away the pile of physics grad school applications I had, and requested a bunch of math ones. I went to graduate school for a year at Stony Brook, then transferred back to Columbia for the rest of my Ph.D., because my then-girlfriend, now-wife, was continuing on from Columbia undergrad to grad school.

And if they can get away with boarding before their row is called, they&rsquo;ll do that too. Someone close to me retorted, &ldquo;competition made the human race what it is today.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t stopped thinking about that remark ever since. Can this person be right? I dearly, dearly hope not. Because all I can think of in reply is, &ldquo;yes, it did make us what we are &ndash; especially the World Wars and the Holocaust.&rdquo;

      I&rsquo;m listening to The Return of the King: The Complete Recordings at work, and I&rsquo;m at the point near the (first) end when Frodo and Sam have just destroyed the ring (with Gollum&rsquo;s unwitting help) and they&rsquo;re escaping the flowing lava by standing on a rock, feeling a relieved. With all the events of the story to back up the scene, I think it&rsquo;s truly moving to see these two regular guys, who together destroyed a great and senseless evil power. I actually see it as a very tragic moment, when two of the world&rsquo;s great forces are being presented to us via the heightened drama of this point in the story: senseless evil/destruction/chaos on the one hand, and the fortitude and perseverance and good of the common person on the other hand. You can ask all sorts of questions at this point, like if the common person is so good, where is all the evil coming from? Why must the most ordinary and good people sustain such injury and sacrifice to ward off the worst effects of the evil?

      A while back I wanted to read The Lord of the Rings aloud with my wife. We&rsquo;ve read lots of books together this way, and I&rsquo;m a huge LOTR fan, so I really wanted to share it. The problem is it&rsquo;s very long and many people consider lots of it boring. So, I took a clever (if I do say so myself) shortcut! I went through the books and dog-eared ranges of pages where the plot differed from the movies in a way I thought significant or noteworthy. For example, I read the entire chapter &ldquo;The scouring of the shire&rdquo; because this was left out of the movie. I highlighted the differences in Denethor&rsquo;s character as much as I could, as well as Faramir&rsquo;s. Both were substantially diminished in moral quality in the movies.

In a way, the Jasons are a sequel to the very successful Manhattan Project, and there is lots of overlap of personnel. The Jasons came into being in the aftermath of the Soviet launch of Sputnik, in 1960 to be exact.

I would like to be very careful about where I plan and do not plan to take issue with him, so let me start in Part 1 by delineating the argument.

      I&rsquo;ve had poker on my mind since last Thanksgiving, specifically Texas Hold&rsquo;em. At this point, I have special hold&rsquo;em software, four poker strategy books and one nonfiction book about poker. I mostly study the books and play a bit with the software, but eventually I want to start a real-money account on one of the online poker sites. I feel that if I apply what&rsquo;s in the books, then I can win money, which would be a very fun goal to shoot for. Of course, to avoid having a gambling problem I have to tread very carefully and lower my expectations within reason for the early stages. I have been procrastinating setting up a new checking account for my poker money both because I truly hesitate to take this step, and because I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;m good enough yet.

      I&rsquo;ve been renting Ken Burns&rsquo; Civil War shows lately, from Netflix. I thought I&rsquo;d share a misconception I learned I had about the Civil War. My memory from school left me thinking that the war would involve a large set of complicated virtuosic battlefield maneuvers, and that I&rsquo;d come to appreciate how all the famous generals were geniuses. In fact, I&rsquo;d somehow developed the opinion that the generals during that war outshine generals in other wars, that through a coincidence of history, the best strategists somehow simultaneously appeared during that conflict.

      I&rsquo;ve always thought Tolkien was essentially pessimistic, despite the happy ending of The Lord of the Rings. The power of Evil he describes, and the inevibatle comparisons to the horror of World War I make this a convincing point of view. The army of Gondor is forced to risk a suicidal attack against a formidable foe to even preserve their tiny ghost of a chance of victory.

      This winter I read three books by C. S. Lewis: The Great Divorce, The Screwtape Letters and Surprised by Joy.
I&rsquo;ve been introduced to Lewis before, when I was young. I read the first several books of the Narnia series, and I read the whole Out of the Silent Planet trilogy. Back then, however, I was looking for pure entertainment from those books, and although they delivered it, the religious level was also apparent, and detracted from their enjoyment for me.

      After nearly three years of development, MathType 5 for Mac has been released.
It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to moving on to other projects, but for now I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s finished.

      I&rsquo;ll be adding my thoughts soon about three books by C. S. Lewis that I&rsquo;ve recently finished. Although I had a few false starts with the Narnia books as a youth, these were read more to find out about the real Christian thinker, and because I wanted to branch out from Tolkien to some of his colleagues.

      A few weeks ago I decided to put some thought into why I have so much trouble getting good at real-time strategy computer games. I went ahead and submitted it to GameSpot, my favorite gaming news site, which does a weekly set of op-ed pieces with a slot for a reader to opine. Well, my article was accepted! Have a read &ndash; I&rsquo;m the second one down.
