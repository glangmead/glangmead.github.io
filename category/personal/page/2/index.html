      Got wireless today! It&rsquo;s totally new to me, but not to most other people, so I won&rsquo;t dwell on it. Anyway, I&rsquo;m in bed, which means Penelope is in the chair and Alison&rsquo;s got her arms all over my pillows. This laptop has a very loud hard drive, which I already knew, but which is a bit more of a problem in this context.

Yesterday was my 30th birthday. Alison threw me a surprise party (just the two of us) on Friday night and made me a bunny cake! Yesterday she gave me a bottle of really nice tequila, and I had some with breakfast ;-). My brother got me a book, and there are more gifts on the way that I don&rsquo;t know what they are. Alison and I had a nice visit to our favorite boba tea place in Long Beach, then headed over to Anaheim to see the Angels play the Mariners, and I got a proper Angels hat. It&rsquo;s made of really light, breathable material and it was very comfortable. It also represents some sort of turning point for me, as I do not change baseball allegience lightly, though eventually I guess I always do.

      So I guess I&rsquo;ve made a mess of all my various weblogs. First there was a Movable Type blog in 2001, then a radio blog, then a new radio blog, and then this new Movable Type blog. I&rsquo;m going to settle on this one, but all my old posts to the other blogs will just have to be lost unless I can muster the enthusiasm for scrounging them up somehow.

      Now that I&rsquo;m finished American Gods, I&rsquo;m just reading The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch. It&rsquo;s about physics, quantum computation, DNA, and lots of other topics, sort of unified into a really interesting and idiosyncratic world-view. David Deutsch is a father of quantum computing, so he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. I always prefer well-expressed personal viewpoints to bland, objective information.

      I just finished reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman. I enjoyed it, but it was a little slow. Basically it explores the idea (in fictional form) that gods from the various pantheons traveled to America with the settlers and started trying to eke their living here. In this day and age, it&rsquo;s not easy to be a god, and they&rsquo;re almost like pathetic people.

      I was thinking about Close Encounters of the Third Kind the other day. I was pretty young, so take this with a grain of salt, but here&rsquo;s what I was thinking. At the beginning, a mood of chaos is set when as-yet-unintroduced high-ranking officials meet in a remote location where a World War II plane (boat?) has been found. They arrive in a helicopter, and part of the fun and tension of the scene is the landing of this loud helicopter. It really is exciting, because, you know, you don&rsquo;t see helicopters land every day. These guys must really be important, and there must be quite a bit of urgency!

      Alison came up with an interesting quote in her dissertation research on 12th century France:
As I hear more and more about this time period from Alison, I see why she studies history. It sheds light forward onto our own time. Would you describe our current ways of thinking as &ldquo;eschewing univocal interpretations,&rdquo; because I wouldn&rsquo;t. I forget who said the following but I agree and I guess so would the scholars of 1100: the older I get, the more I learn that not only is it okay to hold contradictory beliefs, but the deepest, most important elements of life are bound up in such opposing truths.
