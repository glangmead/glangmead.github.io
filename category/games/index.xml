      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a long history with Infocom games (&amp;ldquo;text adventures&amp;rdquo; was what I called them as a kid, and &amp;ldquo;interactive fiction&amp;rdquo; is the new name). People still write these games, did you know that? There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ifdb.tads.org/&#34;&gt;big archive&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&#34;http://ifcomp.org/&#34;&gt;annual competition&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t played any of the non-Infocom variety, though I think I ought to try one. I have copies of all the data files for all the original Infocom games from the 80s, and for years there has been an open-source program to load these files and let you play the games. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://frotz.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Frotz&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a version of Frotz on all my computers for the last 12 years, including my various Palm PDAs. The only Infocom game I&amp;rsquo;ve ever finished in my life (making it one of like 5 games of any variety that I have ever finished) was &amp;ldquo;Enchanter&amp;rdquo;, which I played on the Palm. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287653015&amp;mt=8&#34;&gt;latest incarnation of Frotz&lt;/a&gt; is for the iPhone, and so of course I downloaded it right away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Panzer Tactics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over this holiday break, I played through all the tutorials in one of my newer DS games &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Atlus-PT-00070-2-Panzer-Tactics/dp/B000TU4M4Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1199053915&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Panzer Tactics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a very engrossing turn-based war game, very much along the lines of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-PS2-ACT-81033-Advance/dp/B0009XEC02/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1199054118&amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Panzer Tactics clicked much more with me, though, and I grasped how to deploy my units intuitively pretty quickly. I think I can take this experience back to Advance Wars as well, and have more fun with it, too. But first, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to start the real campaigns in Panzer Tactics. Then maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/?p=68&#34;&gt;Korsun Pocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve bought my first computer wargame, called &lt;em&gt;Korsun Pocket&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matrixgames.com&#34;&gt;Matrix Games&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to share a short section from the manual, because it gets me pretty excited to play and so I thought it would be a good illustration to share:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;s317_TOAW3_shot9.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://greg.langmead.info/img/s317_TOAW3_shot9.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My interest in the World Wars, and my recent reading of &lt;em&gt;The Guns of August&lt;/em&gt; (Tuchman), led me somehow to look into the wargaming universe. I learned that there is of course a sizable community of computer wargamers and developers, and I took a look around the landscape and selected a few to zero in on. Some of these are on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shelfcentered.com/index.php?event=user_shelf&amp;userid=26&amp;user_shelf=Christmas%202006&#34;&gt;Christmas shelf&lt;/a&gt;, and some I pirated so I could read the manual and get a feel for how it goes.  It turns out the more detailed ones are more appealing so far, such as the one pictured above, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matrixgames.com/games/game.asp?gid=317&#34;&gt;The Operational Art of War III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I actually had time to play some Gameboy games today! I have quite a backlog, which will surprise no one who knows me, and it felt good to give it some attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/04/15/1153203&#34;&gt;Hall of Fame Game M.U.L.E. To Be Ported To PC&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org/&#34;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;M.U.L.E. was one of my favorite games. It&amp;rsquo;s like the modern real-time strategy games we have now, except that it was fun. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be checking this out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
