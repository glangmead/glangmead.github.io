      <title>Rubik&#39;s Cube</title>
      <link>/2015/06/rubiks-cube/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided recently to embrace my dilettantism. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there have been two consecutive days in my life where I wanted to pursue and learn the same ideas. Now mind you, the complete list of topics is finite and I cycle back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently, when I was reminded of the existence of superfast Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube solver people, blindfold solvers, one-handed solvers, and foot solvers, I thought it might finally be time to learn how to solve the cube, and to push down the stack the rest of my crazy research agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks later, I can assert that I can solve the cube within a few minutes. And moreover, I am able to do it with some modicum of understanding of what I am doing. My goal was not to memorize recipes, which is the approach that most tutorials assume for some reason. Instead, I wanted to know the most granular small changes that can be made and how to carry them out, and also &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they work out. And I achieved that! I am impressed with myself, way more than is warranted. This outcome is of course all due to the existence of the Internet and especially YouTube. Here are my favorite links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all current speed records in one video: [youtube=http://youtu.be/83Bd746XZaw&amp;amp;w=400]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;same teacher, but now we&amp;rsquo;re getting somewhere with a discussion of commutators: &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jtmulhol/math302/notes/13-Commutators.pdf&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Lossless Lord of the Rings Blu-ray rip on iPad 3</title>
      <link>/2012/03/lossless-lord-of-the-rings-blu-ray-rip-on-ipad-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have seen what 1080p from a Blu-ray looks like on iPad 3, and it is something to behold. The detail and the colors are just beautiful. Over the last few days I&amp;rsquo;ve worked through the technical issues of ripping one of my Blu-ray discs and converting it losslessly to a format the iPad can play. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for every Blu-ray because they are not all encoded on the disc in H.264. For example, Blade Runner: The Final Cut is encoded in VC1, and so I had to transcode that (but it still looks amazing). But the LOTR Extended trilogy uses H.264 and so you can have perfection. The steps were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Windows, where my Blu-ray reader is, I ran makemkv and ripped the main movie plus all the audio tracks to disc. Each of the 6 discs in this trilogy takes between 20-35 GB of disk space. So, a lot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I copied each .mkv file to my Mac and ran MP4Tools, but just to convert the DTS audio track to AAC stereo format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I opened the .mkv and the AAC in Subler and &amp;ldquo;muxed&amp;rdquo; them together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lord of the Rings project to become a web site</title>
      <link>/2011/06/lord-of-the-rings-project-to-become-a-web-site/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&#34;/?p=114&#34;&gt;have written previously&lt;/a&gt;, I created an annotated list of excerpts from &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; to encapsulate the differences in the plot (and theme) from the Peter Jackson films. I was unhappy with the tabular format of a Google spreadsheet though, and so I cast around for other ways to present this information. My requirements were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  1. Each excerpt should have its own page so I could write expanded versions of my thoughts.

  2. There should be a feature to assign structured metadata to each post so I could assign fields like &amp;quot;page number in edition X&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;novel name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;chapter&amp;quot; and so on.

  3. Each page should support user comments.

  4. There should be a one-page view that is condensed and tabular like the spreadsheet.

  5. There should be a robust category feature so I could group things in various ways.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contemplated using a CMS and even installed a few. But at the end of the day I decided to use WordPress, even though it required some research to solve items 2 and 4. Also, WordPress has a numeric paradigm for linking to posts (each post has a unique number starting from 1), and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that because it makes the excerpts look sequential. Although they are sequential in a sense (inside the novels) if I ever were to insert a new excerpt between two existing ones, it would have a nonsequential post ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found solutions to all of this, but haven&amp;rsquo;t fully implemented everything yet. The results will go up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lotr.langmead.info&#34;&gt;http://lotr.langmead.info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post to test the functionality of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathjax.org&#34;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;. Just put a simple script tag in your header, pointing to a global copy of mathjax.js distributed via Amazon&amp;rsquo;s CloudFront content distribution network. After that, you can enter LaTeX or MathML directly in your posts and MathJax will render it into beautiful equations. Here is a favorite (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210192&#34;&gt;my dissertation&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ \Pi \wedge^{2}&lt;em&gt;{+}TX\otimes\wedge^{2}&lt;/em&gt;{+}T^{&lt;em&gt;}X \hookrightarrow

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m fixing a typo where I typed &amp;ldquo;loose&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo;, then is it less wasteful if I click inside and delete one of the &amp;ldquo;o&amp;quot;s, versus double-clicking the whole word and typing four brand new letters? If I do it the first way, it seems like I am reusing the existing four correct letters, so it seems less wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]
I learned something new this weekend. First, I learned that one of my favorite childhood games, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon:_The_Light_and_the_Dark&#34;&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, has some spiritual successors. The game designer Paul Reiche III, who designed Archon, went on to design other games from his studio Toys for Bob. I just learned all of this when I was listening to a podcast where some old timers like me were discussing the game Star Control 2, which Reiche designed and which was released for PC in 1992, and then on 3DO. It sounded like a great game, and given the Archon pedigree I was curious to try it out. Well the good news is that 3DO released the source code back to Reiche in 2002 and he made it open source, and so there are many ways to &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc2.sourceforge.net/downloads.php&#34;&gt;play the game today on modern hardware&lt;/a&gt; including Mac, PC, Wii, and Android. The name &amp;ldquo;Star Control 2&amp;rdquo; is trademarked and so this open source version is called &amp;ldquo;The Ur-Quan Masters.&amp;rdquo; Having played for 30 minutes, I was immediately drawn in to the accessible gameplay, the gentle introduction that gives you full control but subtly guides you to try new things, and the tinge of humor in the dialog. An abandonware success story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only bad news is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://cci-games.com/&#34;&gt;the iPhone port&lt;/a&gt; seems to have stalled just when it was almost complete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Star Wars for Toddlers is a go</title>
      <link>/2010/09/star-wars-for-toddlers-is-a-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2010 19:19:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2010/09/star-wars-for-toddlers-is-a-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished editing Star Wars, and my 3-year-old loves it, and I feel guilt-free about showing it to her. There were some wrinkles during the process, so the current version is actually the third one I made (I&amp;rsquo;m REAL familiar with the movie now, at least around the problematic scenes). I ended up having success with the Mac-based tool &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplemoviex.com/SimpleMovieX/&#34;&gt;SimpleMovieX&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact it&amp;rsquo;s the first piece of software I&amp;rsquo;ve paid for in a long time (and it&amp;rsquo;s not cheap, $40). The free version is full-featured, but saving out the whole movie would have taken a couple of days because they deliberately slow down file saves in order to get you to pay. Still, I ended up liking that particular method of having a free trial, because it let me experiment with all the features over any number of weeks or months (which is sometimes how long it takes me to get my act together).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I would like to make a fourth version. In addition to fixing a couple of my edits, I have two other problems. First, the file size is too big, and I think I can get decent quality with a lower bit rate and smaller file size. Secondly, there is a white line along the bottom. I believe this is because the software decided to render it at 768x327 instead of 768x328. Many players assume a multiple of four for the resolution, and so put a white line since there&amp;rsquo;s no data on the 328th row. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to force SimpleMovieX to use a different size, since it only had a short pop-up of choices. Maybe I can use a different tool for the transcoding part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any good tools that could work directly from a DVD rip, so I had to encode to H.264 with very high quality and size, edit that, and transcode it. Moreover, I had started off hoping to directly edit the H.264 and just save it out, but the audio kept getting out of sync more and more after each edit. I learned about keyframes, and that&amp;rsquo;s how I found SimpleMovieX, whose primary feature was to let me only visit keyframes while editing, but it helped NOT AT ALL. Come to think of it, if SimpleMovieX didn&amp;rsquo;t let me edit, and didn&amp;rsquo;t transcode well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ve even found the right tool after all. But I did get a pretty good result, so there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter is 3, and her best friend is also 3. He has been shown the entire Star Wars trilogy already, and is in love with Darth Vader. So my daughter hears about it a lot, and is excited to see it too. Recently I showed her a couple moments from Episode 4, and she loved it. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to make a version of the movie that is appropriate for her. I&amp;rsquo;ll edit out everything I deem too intense or violent, and see how it goes. So far, I have a rip of the DVD, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get it into iMovie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let&#39;s hurry along the iPad gaming revolution</title>
      <link>/2010/07/lets-hurry-along-the-ipad-gaming-revolution/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2010 19:19:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2010/07/lets-hurry-along-the-ipad-gaming-revolution/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so excited at the possibilities the iPad holds for gaming, especially strategy gaming. Others have voiced enthusiasm, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s another level or two of excitement that folks are missing. So let&amp;rsquo;s hasten the story along because I want to play these games. Let me convince you I&amp;rsquo;m right, and then you can go make some games for me. I&amp;rsquo;ll pay $50 for the games I have in mind. Do you hear me, Matrix, Paradox, Slitherine, Panther, Creative Assembly, SSG, Firaxis, Big Huge Games, TGW, Wizards, and friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best examples of strategy games on the iPad right now are Small World and Civilization Revolution. I consider these &amp;ldquo;console-like&amp;rdquo; games, since Civ Rev is in fact a port of a console game, and Small World is in the same vein as the recent spate of board game conversions for XBLA, like Catan, Carcassonne, Lost Cities, and Ticket to Ride. I&amp;rsquo;d like to argue that these titles are not nearly ambitious enough, because I think the iPad can supplant every aspect of PC gaming due to the touch interface. Small World comes closer to what I mean since it uses touch, and it makes excellent use of pretty 2D graphics and sound, but still, it could easily live on XBLA. Conversely, I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason all of Civ IV couldn&amp;rsquo;t be brought to the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console comparison, however, is strengthened by the analogy of the App Store to the curated download stores that live in the consoles. John Gruber of daringfireball.net makes the case that the iPad and iPhone are best thought of as &amp;ldquo;app consoles&amp;rdquo; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/03/fraser-back-in&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). So I expect to see  games that are only as ambitious as XBLA titles for a while, but I am sure much more is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the iPad in your hands and using your fingers is a whole different level of control than that offered by the game consoles. An iPad is great for reading, and for touching. It offers terrific precision, and greater immersion than a PC. It has a gaggle of new UI paradigms that are best observed in the non-game apps that exist now, like Mail, Pages and Keynote. The popover menu is one example (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://img.skitch.com/20100409-nej8itjh3uirkwk5gkq6tr2t7h.jpg&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). All of this can bring nice, neat order to complex interfaces. This, in fact, is one of Apple&amp;rsquo;s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel strongly that reading on the iPad is an entirely different experience than reading on a laptop screen or monitor. There is empirical evidence to back this up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ipad-kindle-reading.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (punchline: reading on an iPad, Kindle, or from a real book scores about 5.7/7 whereas reading on the PC scores 3.6/7). But you don&amp;rsquo;t need the studies really, because if you try one you will see. Reading web pages on the iPad is actually a joyful experience. My theory is that the brain processes visual input differently when it&amp;rsquo;s being held in your hands. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the reinforcement coming from using two of your senses, even if all there is to touch is smooth glass. Whatever the reason, and however surprising it seems to you, it&amp;rsquo;s just not the same medium as the PC screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the iPad offers a device where reading is superior to a PC, interactivity is superior in many ways (every device has an accelerometer, compass, and a mic and speakers, which developers can count on), and the UI is different, and arguably superior, but certainly not inferior (touch versus mouse). Plus new UI paradigms exist that smart designers can take advantage of to bridge the remaining gap in screen real estate. So why limit ourselves to ports of simple boardgames? I want to see Advanced Squad Leader and other wargames brought to the iPad as ports from the physical games. I want to see all the Paradox titles and SSG and Panther wargames brought over, as ports from the PC games. (Strangely enough, Paradox announced an iPhone port of Hearts of Iron and Majesty in 2008, but then never followed up in words or deeds. The press release has been removed from their archive, but some game sites are still tracking the HOI port, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://wireless.ign.com/objects/143/14304006.html&#34;&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;.) I want to see the back catalog brought over as well: X-Com, Heroes of Might and Magic, you name it! (Someone is working on DOSBox for iOS, called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.litchie.net/apps/dospad.html&#34;&gt;DOSPad&lt;/a&gt;, but it will probably not be approved given current App Store policies.) I&amp;rsquo;m just naming the games of most interest to me, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really see any limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all those games are brought over, there&amp;rsquo;s even another level we can go, because none of these ports will make full use of the accelerometer and multitouch capabilities, and the greater immersion possible on the iPad. I can&amp;rsquo;t foresee those games, though, because I&amp;rsquo;m not a designer. One category of example for the hardcore strategy gamer might be a hybrid approach where a board game or wargame with lots of rules and calculations could have a tabletop component and an iPad component that makes playing more fun. You could even take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; idea to the next level by making the game even more complex without adding strain to the players. It would be some sort of interactive engine that contains all the rules. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. Maybe what we want are sandboxes with lots of pieces and board configurations, and we can play whatever game we want and enforce the rules ourselves like with boardgames. I&amp;rsquo;d especially love a sandbox that came with MTG cards but didn&amp;rsquo;t force the linear application of rules into the UI the way Duels of the Planeswalkers does, but rather leaves it up to me like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.octgn.net/&#34;&gt;OCTGN2&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magicworkstation.com/&#34;&gt;Magic Workstation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, having said ALL of that, I actually do like the way things are going. There&amp;rsquo;s an X-COM clone in the works for iPad (&lt;a href=&#34;http://isochron.jseuss.com/&#34;&gt;Isochron&lt;/a&gt;), and plenty of SRPG originals and ports coming (e.g., Final Fantasy Tactics in September). As I learned on Three Moves Ahead, Small World was profitable for Days of Wonder on its first day of release, so that will surely be noticed, and hopefully at least all the XBLA board games will be brought over. But what I really want is EU3!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few theories about the origin of our expression &amp;ldquo;OK.&amp;rdquo; But I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across this one that occurred to me the other day. When you hold your hand in that gesture that means &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;, you make a circle with your thumb and index finger. That&amp;rsquo;s an O, and your other three fingers sort of make a &amp;ldquo;K&amp;rdquo;. The middle finger is the vertical stem, and the other two fingers are the diagonal ones. Just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distance learning for the over-educated</title>
      <link>/2010/03/distance-learning-for-the-over-educated/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2010 02:51:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2010/03/distance-learning-for-the-over-educated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m definitely a &amp;ldquo;lifelong learner&amp;rdquo; type, always craving new courses, books, or ideas. I even love reading long computer game manuals for complicated games like Europa Universalis 3. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to learn the beginning of a new field, because there are usually some audiobooks, Teaching Company courses, or online materials to introduce you to the main concepts. But what if you already know a lot about something, and you want to learn even more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you are already educated in a field, and you want to learn about a sub-field, or a more advanced version of what you already know? Here, your options are more limited. If you are lucky enough to live near a college or university, and that university teaches in your field, and offers a course in the sub-field you want to explore, and you have time to audit a course, and the professor permits you to audit, and you manage to attend twice a week while holding down a job, then goody for you! I am almost in that boat, since I live in Pittsburgh, which has several colleges and universities, including two major universities that have several departments covering the areas I love. In browsing the Fall 2010 class schedules, I see a few courses I&amp;rsquo;d like to take. Some are more related to work, some are more related to my past life as a mathematician. If I convince myself I should take time during the work day to take a class, then I might be in luck. But what if I specifically wanted to take a graduate-level class in, say, algebraic geometry, and none was on offer in the Fall? Are there online algebraic geometry courses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Believe me, I looked everywhere. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msri.org&#34;&gt;MSRI&lt;/a&gt; has lots of lectures posted online, and they are usually long workshops that might constitute a good introduction to a subject, but their videos are all broken and have been since I first went to the site, and are still broken three weeks after I wrote to inform them they were broken. I looked at everything in iTunes U, and those cover mainly undergraduate topics, and the few exceptions were not interesting to me. I looked at MIT OpenCourseware, but everything with video lectures is on iTunes U, which I already know doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover what I want. Lecture notes don&amp;rsquo;t help any more than books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about books? I have lots of books. I have one next to me called &amp;ldquo;Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators&amp;rdquo; which is beautiful and fun to read. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have the discipline to work through it all alone. I need the structure of a class, or a seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An informal seminar would be fantastic. If I knew someone in Pittsburgh who wanted to work through &amp;ldquo;Heat Kernels&amp;rdquo; with me, that would probably be the best possible outcome. But the odds that there is such a person and that I will meet them during my limited time outside of work is zilch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my dual proposal for the world. First, please record video of all your graduate courses and sell them on iTunes, or offer them free through iTunes U, or offer them to distance learning students at a reasonable rate, and make the course easy to find. I mean, my own alma mater, Columbia University, should offer me, an alumnus, video of all the math department courses. I&amp;rsquo;d love them for it. Yes I took some of those courses, but now, years later, I&amp;rsquo;d take different ones, and different ones would be offered than were offered during my years there anyway, and it would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part two of my proposal is for the Web 2.0 entrepreneurs. Let me meet, non-awkwardly, on a web site, people like myself, and form an ad-hoc videoconferencing seminar. We would agree on the reading material, and take turns presenting chapters or sections of the material, like in a regular seminar. Video skype, plus screen sharing or web conferencing, plus whiteboards, it could totally work! The technology all exists, we just need a way to find each other, and to have a web site with enough features to support it. Should I create it? Would anybody show up? Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll post to mathoverflow.com and see if anyone agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving digital items is hard</title>
      <link>/2009/12/giving-digital-items-is-hard/</link>

      <guid>/2009/12/giving-digital-items-is-hard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of a few things I like: books, audiobooks, music, movies, video games, iPhone apps. I consume these items on a variety of devices: Kindle, iPhone, PC, Mac, Xbox, PS3, Wii. Most of those platforms have a digital download mechanism in place for the software, e.g. you can download music or audiobooks from the iTunes store, Amazon or Audible. You can download movies from iTunes, Amazon, Xbox, or PS3. You download iPhone apps from iTunes. You can download Kindle books from Amazon. You can download many PC games from Steam. Some games are ONLY available for download. The consoles have their own built-in stores that use points or a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the permutations and combinations, only a handful permit gift-giving. You can &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; (as we say now) iTunes music, movies, or audiobooks from one account to another. You can do the same with Steam to give someone a PC game. You can purchase an Xbox downloadable game code from Amazon and give it to somebody. That&amp;rsquo;s it, that&amp;rsquo;s the full subset of the above available for giving as a gift. You cannot give iPhone apps, Amazon music or movies, Kindle books, or PS3 or Wii downloadable games. The best gift-giving experience is still to give someone a physical item, but as time goes on that&amp;rsquo;s just not what I want to receive, with the notable exception of movies. I am not yet comfortable owning a purely digital version of a movie. I want to have the disc, preferably blu-ray since the quality is the highest possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone hack: reading strap</title>
      <link>/2009/11/iphone-hack-reading-strap/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2009 15:04:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2009/11/iphone-hack-reading-strap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use my iPhone quite heavily as an ebook reader. I read in various situations, but one of the most frequent is when I&amp;rsquo;m in bed. When you&amp;rsquo;re lying down, either on your back or on your side, it can be quite a strain on your hand muscles to grip the phone and also use your thumb to scroll the pages. So a while back, I came up with a super-cheap way to improve the situation by adding a strap that holds the phone to your hand (actually, it holds it to just your index finger). Whenever I show this trick to other folks, including seasoned, cynical tech folks, they seem impressed. So I thought I would post it for search engines to find. All you need are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  * an iPhone or iPod touch, any model
  * a case that covers just the back of your phone
  * a thick rubber band (you might need to try a few sizes to get one that&#39;s comfy)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried other kinds of straps besides a rubber band, but the elasticity and rubber material both make it very comfortable and easy to grip your hand. You might need to try a few different sizes of rubber band, to get the tightness and thickness that are most comfortable for you. Lay all these items out like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_1201.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice my Incipio case is looking cracked and old, after just a year! I do not recommend that brand. I think the dust inside is from all the rubber bands I&amp;rsquo;ve used :). Anyway, next you wrap the rubber band around the case. I find that if you do it at an angle, it is more comfortable for your hand and provides more alternatives for finger positions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_1203.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;rubber band around case&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, put the iphone in the case, on top of the rubber band. You may have to work some slack into the rubber band, so that the phone can nestle into the case without straining against the rubber band. The phone won&amp;rsquo;t fit all the way into the case since the rubber band has some thickness, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_1204.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;iPhone, rubber band, and case&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is from the back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_1205.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;rear view&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever you want to hold the phone for extended periods, just slip your index finger through the rubber band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_1206.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;finger in rubber band&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hand muscles can relax, and you can much more easily use your thumb to scroll the pages of an ebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_1207.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;scrolling ebook&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure a case manufacturer could do much better with a built-in strap, but so far I have yet to see a case like that. In the meantime, enjoy this trick and enjoy reading ebooks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac Moments: Not using paths</title>
      <link>/2009/07/mac-moments-not-using-paths/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2009 03:14:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2009/07/mac-moments-not-using-paths/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my Mac, I had a movie in my Movies folder called &amp;ldquo;Sesame Street Season 1 part 1.m4v&amp;rdquo;. I dragged it to iTunes so I could play it there (for my daughter), and all was well. One day I wanted to move those old Sesame Streets into a folder called &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo;, so I made the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; folder and dragged that movie in, no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iTunes still had a record of that movie file of course, but what happens when I ask iTunes to play it? What do you think &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to happen? What do you &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; would happen? What do you think computers are &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of enabling to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what happens on a Mac: it plays the movie, and on Windows and all other operating systems, it does not. This is not about iTunes. The distinction holds for any piece of software at all that maintains pointers to files, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a media organizer, or a Recent Documents feature in a word processor. This is because on Windows, there is no other system-provided mechanism for storing file locations besides paths. Paths include the name of all enclosing folders, plus the filename, plus of course the drive letter on Windows, e.g. &amp;ldquo;C:\Documents and Settings\Greg\My Movies\Sesame Street Season 1 part 1.m4v&amp;rdquo;. If I change the path to include &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; partway along the chain, which is what moving the file into &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; amounts to, then the path has changed and the original path is invalid, it points to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not describe the technical details of the mechanism the Mac uses instead, because frankly it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, that&amp;rsquo;s the whole point. It&amp;rsquo;s a smart piece of technology that hides from the user, but enables the user to work in a more intuitive way. It permits all software not to be sensitive to changes the user makes to the locations of files or folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism has existed since the early days of the Mac. It&amp;rsquo;s not some fancy modern cpu-intensive disk-intensive feature that indexes your hard drive or anything. It&amp;rsquo;s just a better way of storing file locations in software, since users like to move stuff around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those differences that I usually have trouble articulating, but subconsciously affects all my decisions, just like the fragility of paths affects many of my decisions when I&amp;rsquo;m using Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lord of the Rings in 100 48 pages</title>
      <link>/2009/07/lord-of-the-rings-in-100-48-pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2009 18:12:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2009/07/lord-of-the-rings-in-100-48-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of Peter Jackson’s movie versions of The Lord of the Rings novels. A HUGE fan. But I am also a fan of the books, which I have read several times, and which I have also done supplementary reading on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is for anyone who enjoyed watching the movies, is willing to re-watch the extended editions, and has a desire to read the books but hesitates to invest the full time required to read 3 novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have done is go through the books and find the paragraphs where the story differs from the story told in the movies. This serves two purposes. Firstly, for me, there are a few things I felt were especially disappointing or overlooked in the movies, including elements that I consider thematically crucial, and I want others to share in that opinion without having to read every word. Secondly, for you, it will allow you to use the movies to substitute for most of the content of the novels, which when added to the material I am listing here, will give you the entire story as presented in the book. It will also give you good exposure to Tolkien’s writing style and the tone of the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to make it easy for you to follow along no matter what edition of the novels you have. I have provided page numbers for the 3-paperback version published by Ballantine in 1993, and the red single-volume collector’s edition. But in addition I provide the chapter number and the snippet of text that begins and ends the excerpt, plus the approximate number of pages the excerpt runs in my paperback edition, just to give you a sense of the size of the excerpt. If you own the Kindle or another electronic edition, you can probably type in my snippets to find the beginning. I have also annotated each excerpt, to indicate why I am including it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that each novel has two sets of chapters numbered from 1, since it’s actually a 6 ‘book’ story the way Tolkien divided it up. So &amp;ldquo;TTT 2.5&amp;rdquo; means &lt;em&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/em&gt;, book 2, chapter 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table is available as &lt;a href=&#34;http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmZerv8xRx48dDVBV2ZxUk1FaEdyRmFQbUU4ZHJ5b2c&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;a Google spreadsheet document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My interpretation of 42% pro-choice</title>
      <link>/2009/05/my-interpretation-of-42-pro-choice/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2009 02:44:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2009/05/my-interpretation-of-42-pro-choice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going way out on a limb here, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42% of Americans are pro-choice, according to a new Gallup poll, and 51% are pro-life. My response to this is: since so many Americans disagree with the pro-life stance, then we should stick with the neutral road, which is the policy to keep abortions legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are against abortion may avoid having them, and convince those around them not to have them, either. That is also neutral. What is not neutral is to project one&amp;rsquo;s morality onto others and require adherence without sharing the morality. Not when there is so much disagreement. There is no clear morality here if 42% disagree. Morality is not democracy, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll agree, but when did it become OK to require conformance to one view in the presence of many others? Maybe in Afghanistan, but not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If John is pro-life and Mary has an abortion, she does not commit any sin against John. John is NOT INVOLVED unless he actively and aggressively meddles. Any view that reaches out and forms an opinion about the actions of others is suspect. I question the motives of that person, because I suspect they are overcome by their will to dominate others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see the poll numbers broken down by response to the question &amp;ldquo;are you anti-abortion?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading an interesting book about economics, public policy, and psychology. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X%3FSubscriptionId%3D13D7MCZQKMM5E1WMY782%26tag%3Dshelfcentered-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D014311526X&#34;&gt;Nudge&lt;/a&gt;. They make many interesting points that were completely new to me about the way people do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; behave in the rational manner modeled by the previous generation of economists. In fact, there are systematic biases in our decision-making that can be quantified and worked around by enacting sensible policies. The cover issues ranging from the Medicare prescription drug plan to 401k plans, to organ donation, to the environment. The ideas are presented clearly with lots of examples. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so tired of living with Windows Vista. Especially when it comes to USB. Whenever I plug in a USB device that I&amp;rsquo;ve used a million times before, but I plug it into a different USB port, Vista goes into overdrive. &amp;ldquo;Searching for driver!&amp;rdquo; it exclaims in a balloon. The hard drive churns and churns for about two minutes. You can&amp;rsquo;t do anything else disk-intensive during this time, so basically you&amp;rsquo;re just waiting at this point. If you click the little tray icon that appears, it says &amp;ldquo;Searching for driver in installed locations&amp;rdquo; or something. Finally it&amp;rsquo;s done and it says &amp;ldquo;Canon digital camera.&amp;rdquo; No kidding, the one I plugged in yesterday? Congratulations. Maybe I should plug it into each port in my hub so that I can go through this once and then know that I&amp;rsquo;m safe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the feeling I get after I tweak what songs are on my iPhone. I added a composer (Mahler) and a Teaching Company course (about Mahler) because I finished listening to another course (about US relations with the Middle East). I added some Beatles album art and the latest Ben Folds album. It&amp;rsquo;s all freshened up and ready for new listening!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Infocom games, using your voice</title>
      <link>/2008/08/infocom-games-using-your-voice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2008 05:17:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2008/08/infocom-games-using-your-voice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a long history with Infocom games (&amp;ldquo;text adventures&amp;rdquo; was what I called them as a kid, and &amp;ldquo;interactive fiction&amp;rdquo; is the new name). People still write these games, did you know that? There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ifdb.tads.org/&#34;&gt;big archive&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&#34;http://ifcomp.org/&#34;&gt;annual competition&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t played any of the non-Infocom variety, though I think I ought to try one. I have copies of all the data files for all the original Infocom games from the 80s, and for years there has been an open-source program to load these files and let you play the games. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://frotz.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Frotz&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a version of Frotz on all my computers for the last 12 years, including my various Palm PDAs. The only Infocom game I&amp;rsquo;ve ever finished in my life (making it one of like 5 games of any variety that I have ever finished) was &amp;ldquo;Enchanter&amp;rdquo;, which I played on the Palm. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287653015&amp;amp;mt=8&#34;&gt;latest incarnation of Frotz&lt;/a&gt; is for the iPhone, and so of course I downloaded it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDAs in general are not the easiest devices to type on, though, and there&amp;rsquo;s lots of typing in Infocom games. So it occurred to me that it would be really cool to speak the commands. After all, there is a limited vocabulary, which should be ideal for getting good accuracy from automatic speech recognition, and furthermore the engine should require a pretty small amount of data. On top of that, what if Frotz synthesized a (pleasant, configurable) computer voice to read you all the text in the game? Then you could set the iPhone down in front of you, close your eyes, and enjoy a nice bit of interactive fiction by having a dialog with thin air. All of a sudden the very stodgiest and oldest of technology leapfrogs three decades of competition and actually sounds futuristic! I patted myself on the back for thinking of such a great idea, and told myself I&amp;rsquo;d take a stab at it myself &amp;ldquo;one day,&amp;rdquo; since speech recognition is just a hop, skip and a jump away from machine translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not all, there&amp;rsquo;s a punchline to this story. It further occurred to me that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been the first to think of this idea, so I did a Google search. &lt;a href=&#34;http://iphonefrotz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/SPEECH&#34;&gt;The link I found&lt;/a&gt; is inside a code repository for Frotz itself, namely the iPhone version. Actually, this is just a branch of Frotz, so I checked the general Frotz SourceForge repository as well and the same file is there too. It&amp;rsquo;s a placeholder for future work on just this idea, but it&amp;rsquo;s super-vague and kind of creepy, what with the whole &amp;ldquo;commissioned by a presently undisclosed party&amp;rdquo; thing. The technology looks good, it&amp;rsquo;s all open-source stuff released by academics, which was where I figured I would start looking as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who wrote this document, and when, and when do they intend to come out of the shadows with the result of their work? Who knows &amp;ndash; but it sure is a weird end to my story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The iPhone does not display any progress bar or countdown to let you know when the song you&amp;rsquo;re listening to will end. If you tap the screen, such a bar is temporarily displayed, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t there all the time. On the classic iPod, in iTunes, and in most other software-based music players, we&amp;rsquo;ve been getting used to having these indicators. I don&amp;rsquo;t like them because I think a song should set its own pace. I think it detracts from the listening experience to see there are 30 seconds left, because when I see that, I start thinking about how short a time that is, and will the rest of the song really fit because they have a whole other chorus to sing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad the iPhone does not show this information all the time, and I hope it becomes an option in the other players I use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone versus Clie</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/clie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Clie TH55&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/iphone1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;iPhone 3G&#34;&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve owned a Palm or Clie device (which used the Palm OS) for 8 years. I used them as my PIM and as an eBook reader. My very first blog post was about eBooks, back in 2001. But my needs for a calendar are slim (but not zero), and my need for contact information is confined to making phone calls, which my devices couldn&amp;rsquo;t do, or sending Christmas cards, when I&amp;rsquo;m at home. So eventually my latest Clie, the TH-55, sat on my bedside table as my bedtime eBook reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have an iPhone 3G and Fictionwise has ported my eBook reader to the iPhone platform. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to say the phone has subsumed all the Clie&amp;rsquo;s functionality, plus it&amp;rsquo;s a phone and an iPod. Its screen is beautiful, it&amp;rsquo;s the same size as the Clie, and the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a phone means it now matters that I have contact info. The fact that it&amp;rsquo;s always syncing with my computer means it&amp;rsquo;s a great home for my calendar data. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I need to think of a useful app to bring shelfcentered functionality to the iPhone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewell, Clie, we hardly knew ye.&lt;/p&gt;

I bought an iPhone 3G this past weekend (and waited 4 1/2 hours for the privilege). One of its functions is to play your music/movies like an iPod. You access this feature through a button labeled &amp;ldquo;iPod&amp;rdquo;. It has a picture of an &lt;em&gt;old, non-iPhone&lt;/em&gt; iPod on it. This struck me as funny (haha funny). I think of the iPhone as subsuming the iPod in a device with extra functionality. But to explain to the user what this button does, it has a picture of an old iPod on it. And it&amp;rsquo;s not called &amp;ldquo;iTunes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Music and Movies&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Media&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;iPod&amp;rdquo;. So the iPod has become a piece of software, and the hardware has just become an icon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the importance of mentors</title>
      <link>/2008/07/on-the-importance-of-mentors/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2008 04:10:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2008/07/on-the-importance-of-mentors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up assuming that people make their own way in the world. I thought it was up to me to make every decision, plan every move, open every door, and find my own way in my life and career. Only much later did I learn that I was doing it all wrong. Not only is my way much harder, it&amp;rsquo;s also completely miserable to be so isolated. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. The place where I started making these wrong decisions was in college. I attended my classes, which in some cases were way below my capabilities, and in other cases were way above. Either way, at the end of class, I packed up my things and walked back to my room. I dreamed of being a scientist, just like I had since I was 10 years old. But all I did was go to class, I never spoke with any professors, nor was I ever approached by any. My talents started to appear in my sophomore year, but I was still doing things in this retarded way. Then in my junior year the first consequence of my nihilistic lifestyle happened, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even really notice it for what it was until years later. I switched my major from Astronomy to Astrophysics, then I added a concentration (minor) in Math, and then I made Math a second major. This all happened within a couple of months. Even these bureaucratic thrashings didn&amp;rsquo;t raise any red flags in any administrators or professors. No one cared. So, I shifted my focus to math, threw away the pile of physics grad school applications I had, and requested a bunch of math ones. I went to graduate school for a year at Stony Brook, then transferred back to Columbia for the rest of my Ph.D., because my then-girlfriend, now-wife, was continuing on from Columbia undergrad to grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, here&amp;rsquo;s the denoument to the story. In my second year or so, the reference librarian of the math library was leaving Columbia, and she was well-liked by the department. I had worked for her as an undergraduate, so I was invited to her going away party. At that party, there was a professor who was a fixture in the math department. He was the kind of professor who was very focused on undergraduates and mentoring. I had never had a class with him, and had never met him personally until I was a graduate student. We got to chatting, and it came out that I had attended Columbia as an undergrad as well as a grad student. He was shocked. &amp;ldquo;How is it that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember you?&amp;rdquo; he asked. My answer was &amp;ldquo;I do a good job of going under the radar.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story brings me a whole lot of pain. I know that I somehow failed to do &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; right as an undergrad. All those times I walked straight back to my room to lie on my back, have a cigarette, and listen to music, I suspected that I was doing the wrong thing. I knew I should be doing &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; or seeking more opportunities. But how do you do that? I have never been good at taking that feeling and turning it into non-ridiculous-looking actions. But I also suspect that others also failed me. The professors who taught me recognized my talent, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. A few years later I heard from a third party that one of them had called me &amp;ldquo;the best mathematician he has ever met.&amp;rdquo; WTF? Why weren&amp;rsquo;t these people looking out for me, then? Couldn&amp;rsquo;t they see that I had lots of talent but no direction? Professors like the one I was talking to at the going-away party do in fact devote lots of energy to nurturing undergrads. Just not me. So I waver between self-loathing and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am determined to make at least one good thing out of this part of my life story. I will be an excellent mentor, and I will always act when I spot talent. It&amp;rsquo;s happened plenty at my job, and I have been very vocal about singing the praise of new young employees who are talented. I have been instrumental in having them promoted and being assigned interesting work. I will do what was not done for me. The best would be if I ran across someone like myself, who was incapable of grabbing this kind of attention for him or herself. I will see their talent, and their reticence, and I will help them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel was released in 1985 for the Mac and in 1987 for Windows. Today I was using the 2007 version. After 20 years of work by countless engineers, it cannot open two files with the same name, and the dialog is quite shameless about it. That&amp;rsquo;s a good word: &amp;ldquo;shameless.&amp;rdquo; Details are everything. Click to see the full size.

      <title>I won my fight with Windows Media Player</title>
      <link>/2008/05/i-won-my-fight-with-windows-media-player/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2008 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2008/05/i-won-my-fight-with-windows-media-player/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you know, I want to stream movies and music from my PC to my TV. I have an all-star lineup of tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  * PC running Vista with Windows Media Player 11 (WMP11), iTunes, and Zune software
  * Xbox 360
  * PlayStation 3
  * TiVo
  * Airport Express
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a selection of Xvid, Divx, MPEG 4, MP3, and AAC files to stream. These are all extremely widely used formats, the most popular in their categories (the first three are video, the last two are audio). All the players I mentioned play these formats, at least after installing some popular codec packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PlayStation 3 has the best and most responsive remote,  the best music visualizations (cool effects that show on TV while you&amp;rsquo;re listening to music), and the nicest UI. And it natively supports all the formats I listed. So all I have to do is get stuff to stream to it! BUT&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  * Zune will only stream to Xbox 360
  * iTunes will only stream to the Airport Express, which is audio only
  * WMP11 will not add MPEG 4 or AAC files to its library or stream them
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I targeted the MPEG 4 portion of this last point using &lt;a href=&#34;http://a8t8.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2518DD508BB713E8!156.entry?commentPage=Last&amp;amp;commentPH=&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;. It took lots of Googling and experimentation before I finally found those instructions, but it was worth it. I closed the loop, so that I can stream the things that &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; work to the device that &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; play them! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert X. Cringely, my favorite tech pundit, had an interesting aside in this week&amp;rsquo;s column (which is otherwise about Apple and Blu-Ray). He ran across a use of the term &amp;lsquo;bug&amp;rsquo; to mean a glitch in a technical system in a magazine article from the 1930s. I found this fascinating, since we always assume &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; invented the term when computers came along. He closes with this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over this holiday break, I played through all the tutorials in one of my newer DS games &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Atlus-PT-00070-2-Panzer-Tactics/dp/B000TU4M4Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=videogames&amp;amp;qid=1199053915&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Panzer Tactics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a very engrossing turn-based war game, very much along the lines of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-PS2-ACT-81033-Advance/dp/B0009XEC02/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=videogames&amp;amp;qid=1199054118&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Panzer Tactics clicked much more with me, though, and I grasped how to deploy my units intuitively pretty quickly. I think I can take this experience back to Advance Wars as well, and have more fun with it, too. But first, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to start the real campaigns in Panzer Tactics. Then maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/?p=68&#34;&gt;Korsun Pocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over Thanksgiving, I was complaining about people who crowd forward when boarding a plane, even if their row hasn&amp;rsquo;t been called, so that when it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; called, they get on first. And if they can get away with boarding before their row is called, they&amp;rsquo;ll do that too. Someone close to me retorted, &amp;ldquo;competition made the human race what it is today.&amp;rdquo; I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped thinking about that remark ever since. Can this person be right? I dearly, dearly hope not. Because all I can think of in reply is, &amp;ldquo;yes, it did make us what we are &amp;ndash; especially the World Wars and the Holocaust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Return-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000V6BE6M/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1196454269&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Return of the King: The Complete Recordings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at work, and I&amp;rsquo;m at the point near the (first) end when Frodo and Sam have just destroyed the ring (with Gollum&amp;rsquo;s unwitting help) and they&amp;rsquo;re escaping the flowing lava by standing on a rock, feeling a relieved. With all the events of the story to back up the scene, I think it&amp;rsquo;s truly moving to see these two regular guys, who together destroyed a great and senseless evil power. I actually see it as a very tragic moment, when two of the world&amp;rsquo;s great forces are being presented to us via the heightened drama of this point in the story: senseless evil/destruction/chaos on the one hand, and the fortitude and perseverance and good of the common person on the other hand. You can ask all sorts of questions at this point, like if the common person is so good, where is all the evil coming from? Why must the most ordinary and good people sustain such injury and sacrifice to ward off the worst effects of the evil?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Has &lt;em&gt;Masterpiece Theater&lt;/em&gt; always just been some British TV show? Lately they&amp;rsquo;ve been showing &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Mrs. Prithcard&lt;/em&gt;, which felt like an American TV show that happened to be British. Is it a masterpiece? Did they pick it because they felt it was a masterpiece? Maybe they should rename Masterpiece Theater to &amp;ldquo;Some British TV Show&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2007/11/more-on-zune-moron-zune/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Zune software turned out not to be so great at working with iTunes playlists. It&amp;rsquo;s not a dynamic synchronization, just a one-time thing. So after asking the Zune to read my iTunes playlists, it did so, but after I changed my playlists in iTunes, the Zune did not see the change. Also, the Zune does not attempt to pull in the smart playlists, just the static ones. Even just treating the smart playlists as regular ones and pulling in their current contents would have been great, but no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last gripe is that there are playlists I can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of with the attractive names &amp;ldquo;__127.0.0.1&amp;rdquo; and similar. Why is the software showing me its disgusting internal details?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibly good news is that Microsoft have just done a major overhaul to the Zune software, and so some of these problems may be gone. On the other hand, they may be replaced with more ridiculous problems!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two reasons to download Microsoft&#39;s Zune software</title>
      <link>/2007/10/two-reasons-to-download-microsofts-zune-software/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2007 18:05:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2007/10/two-reasons-to-download-microsofts-zune-software/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft includes a Windows-based desktop media player with their Zune portable media players, to manage your music and sync it with the Zune. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot like Windows Media Player, which I despise, but actually if you own an Xbox 360 there are two reasons to install the Zune software even if you don&amp;rsquo;t own a Zune:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can serve MPEG4 and H.264 movies to the Xbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can synchronize its music library and playlists with iTunes automatically, and serve those to the Xbox as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a popular media format supported by many devices: iPod, Zune, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Tivo. Files in this format are sold by the Xbox movie store and the iTunes store. It is also one of the underlying formats supported on both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD formats. So it&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to get all your videos in that format, and when you do, you want to play them on your Xbox 360 in HD, right? Right! Well, the Zune software is the easiest way to do that. It has the same media sharing features (and dialog boxes) as Windows Media Player, it just supports more formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for syncing with iTunes, I just discovered this over the weekend. It does not support playing DRM music purchased at the iTunes store, but as DRM starts to disappear, this will matter less over time. I activated the feature (here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/sync-itunes-windows-media-player-and.htm&#34;&gt; the instructions I used&lt;/a&gt;), and after a long time all my iTunes &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; playlists did in fact appear in Zune and on my Xbox 360 as well (under the Music item of course). But none of my iTunes &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; playlists made it over, which is a shame because I use them rather heavily. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make static playlist copies of the ones I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet discovered how often it syncs up with iTunes, but I&amp;rsquo;ll find out once I make those static playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the Zune software &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zune.net/en-us/meetzune/software.htm&#34;&gt;from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2007/09/struggles-with-new-computer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I bought all the bits and pieces to build a new PC for home. My old one is a few years old now, and isn&amp;rsquo;t up for all the video transcoding I throw at it these days (mainly converting Xvid and Divx TV shows into MP4 for use on Xbox). I&amp;rsquo;m not a real hardware guru, but every few years I read enough to know what the state of the art is and roll up my sleeves for a few weeks. This time I had one small snafu which was that nothing powered on after I put it together. It turned out that the problem was the CPU was not completely seated. I had to twist it off of its heatsink, straighten a bent pin, and re-seat it. Wow, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve installed Vista, and a few basic apps. Next I need to move all my hard drives over, but since for some reason I installed my biggest drive as Raid 0 (with just itself in the array), I have to move the files off and reformat it on the new system. To help with that, I purchased an external USB hard drive that will also help me store completed iMovie projects so that I an keep one Greer movie at a time on my Powerbook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica is a wonderful tech news site that&amp;rsquo;s fast becoming more and more like a &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; news source, with journalists and investigation and everything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070925-amazon-launches-public-beta-of-mp3-music-store.html&#34;&gt;they reviewed&lt;/a&gt; Amazon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/163856011&#34;&gt;new MP3 store&lt;/a&gt;. It sounded very positive because they sell straight MP3 files with no rights management, and so the files will play on my iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I went to the store and browsed. The top 100 albums are all on sale for $8.99, and I saw a new They Might Be Giants album in the list that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about, so I bought it. It was a great experience. You first download a little downloader app that fetches all the songs and adds them directly to the iTunes library. Because they&amp;rsquo;re MP3, they will be playable on Tivo, Xbox, or any other home media device. We&amp;rsquo;re growing increasingly dependent on these sorts of devices around the house, so this is important. Plus the 256kbps encoding is of a very high quality, the highest of any store (tied with Apple&amp;rsquo;s own DRM-free music). And the prices is cheaper than iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One moral is that the iTunes-iPod ecosystem is not so &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo; for me. I left the iTunes music store to use Amazon with no internal debate at all. Now whenever I want new music, I&amp;rsquo;ll check Amazon first, then fall back to iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one disadvantage of Amazon: they only have 2 million songs compared to iTunes&amp;rsquo; 6 million. But surely that&amp;rsquo;s temporary and soon all the stores will have all the same stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lord of the Rings, movie versus book</title>
      <link>/2007/09/lord-of-the-rings-movie-versus-book/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2007 22:46:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2007/09/lord-of-the-rings-movie-versus-book/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I wanted to read &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; aloud with my wife. We&amp;rsquo;ve read lots of books together this way, and I&amp;rsquo;m a huge LOTR fan, so I really wanted to share it. The problem is it&amp;rsquo;s very long and many people consider lots of it boring. So, I took a clever (if I do say so myself) shortcut! I went through the books and dog-eared ranges of pages where the plot differed from the movies in a way I thought significant or noteworthy. For example, I read the entire chapter &amp;ldquo;The scouring of the shire&amp;rdquo; because this was left out of the movie. I highlighted the differences in Denethor&amp;rsquo;s character as much as I could, as well as Faramir&amp;rsquo;s. Both were substantially diminished in moral quality in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go back through what I did, and post it here with annotations, so that others can read the same portions of the books in tandem with the movies to get a much more accurate picture of what the books are all about. The problem is that before I had this great idea, I had already read half of &lt;em&gt;Fellowship&lt;/em&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make some decisions about what parts of that to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac Moments: Software update</title>
      <link>/2007/04/mac-moments-software-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2007 03:44:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2007/04/mac-moments-software-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Makers of software demonstrate their values in their products. Each decision they made along the way is visible to the user in one way or another. Most Windows users I talk to don&amp;rsquo;t even grasp this idea. They claim that Mac users are nigglers, and are too detail-obsessed. But I believe these issues can have an effect on everyone&amp;rsquo;s daily life, in a much bigger way than we generally acknowledge. This post presents a great example of this, namely OS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every month or so, both Mac OS and Windows need to apply some patches, often for security reasons. I approve of this practice, because it helps guarantee the squashing of bugs that can affect security. But my work habits need to be taken into consideration, too. Rebooting my computer is a big deal, and takes a long time, on both platforms. At work, I usually have quite a bit of my own personal state of mind reflected in what&amp;rsquo;s running. I have many command-line sessions, documents, notes, and web browser windows open. These can only be reinstated by re-opening each item one at a time, which takes effort, and constitutes a major interruption, probably 20 minutes before my mind and machine are back where they were. I think interruption is a major drag on productivity in todays multitasking environments, and being able to concentrate for long times is precious. Certainly it adds to my stress to have to bring all this stuff back up when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the two platforms deal with this issue. On the Mac, every so often, a program called Software Update runs by itself. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/wp-content/my_images/mac_way.png&#34; alt=&#34;mac_way.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mac&amp;rsquo;s Software Update interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I want you to notice is the very leftmost column, where the Java update has a blank and the other two have a little power icon. The legend at the bottom says &amp;ldquo;Restart will be required.&amp;rdquo; Each update has its own checkbox controlling whether to install it right now or not, and some text below explains more about the update. The main point I&amp;rsquo;d like to make is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to install any updates that require a restart &lt;em&gt;right now, if I don&amp;rsquo;t want to&lt;/em&gt;. If I don&amp;rsquo;t want to reboot, then I can install the Java update, or not, then I can quit Software Update and keep working. When the internal schedule again causes Software Update to run, or if I go myself to run it to catch up on updates, the updates I skipped will still be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works on Windows. I think I have my machine set up in the most agreeable way as far as this process goes, but if you know of better settings, let me know. Every so often a balloon appears in the tray, asking me to click to check out some updates that are ready to be installed. I set things up so that they&amp;rsquo;re already downloaded. When you click the balloon, you are asked to Express Install, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you anything about what the updates are. If you choose to Manually Install, you see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/wp-content/my_images/windows_way.png&#34; alt=&#34;windows_way.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows XP&amp;rsquo;s software update interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the Mac in many ways, but note that in the text description, it says &amp;ldquo;After you install this item, you may have to restart your computer.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that same text there so many times, it became the motivation for this post. I want to install updates that don&amp;rsquo;t require restarts &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ll install the ones that require a restart &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;, at the end of the week, before I go home for the weekend, which is when I don&amp;rsquo;t mind rebooting my machine. Microsoft neglects to indicate what will happen with this update! Why? Don&amp;rsquo;t they know? If not, why have they made that impossible for themselves? If they do know, why don&amp;rsquo;t they tell me? I think this entire question would be completely lost on them. I say that because anyone who grasps this issue would just tell me! Even if they merely had done a better job copying the Mac they&amp;rsquo;d have gotten it right. As it is, I end up not installing updates like this because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take the gamble of spending the next 20 minutes finding my place in my work again. Basically, I treat it as if it requires a restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, with the update pictured above in fact, I took the plunge, and decided to run the update. What happens next compounds the stupidity of the problem. First there&amp;rsquo;s this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/wp-content/my_images/windows_lose.png&#34; alt=&#34;windows_lose.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I lost the gamble. &amp;ldquo;May have to restart&amp;rdquo; became &amp;ldquo;must restart.&amp;rdquo; I was busy, so I clicked &amp;ldquo;Close.&amp;rdquo; Now this is the best part. Every 30 minutes for the next three work days, the following dialog came up and I had to dismiss it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/wp-content/my_images/windows_worse.png&#34; alt=&#34;windows_worse.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialog I saw dozens of times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time this dialog came up, I grimaced and made a decision whether it was worth it to reboot and get rid of this assinine annoyance, or simply click the &amp;ldquo;Restart Later&amp;rdquo; button and keep doing my job. Finally after a couple days of clicking &amp;ldquo;Restart Later&amp;rdquo;, I gave up and clicked &amp;ldquo;Restart Now&amp;rdquo; and lost the 20 minutes it takes to get back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion can only be that Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t care. And I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that in a small way, I mean it in a big way. This is the kind of nuisance that Windows presents every single day, to tens of millions of computer users. They are grinding us all down with their deprioritization of us, their human users. So I don&amp;rsquo;t even need to argue in this case that Apple is more user-friendly. This case clearly shows that Microsoft has a deep lack of understanding not only of what computers are for, but also what people are for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One view on the state of media-in-the-home</title>
      <link>/2007/02/one-view-on-the-state-of-media-in-the-home/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2007 18:14:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2007/02/one-view-on-the-state-of-media-in-the-home/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased both an Xbox 360 and an HDTV (a 37&amp;rdquo; Sharp Aquos LCD). I have a TiVo, a home network, a Powerbook, and a fast PC with lots of storage. Surely somewhere in all of that is a viable, clean, easy to use method of expanding what I can enjoy on my home entertainment center to include my iTunes music, any downloaded video files, saved TiVo videos, and personal photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive summary is that I&amp;rsquo;m going to be purchasing a Mac Mini when they are next updated by Apple (should be soon), because that is going to be the most flexible entertainment hub. I also learned that our household is more of an Apple shop than I had guessed, mainly due to iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried several scenarios, mostly focused on viewing downloaded TV shows on my TV:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming videos from Windows XP to the Xbox with on-the-fly re-encoding (explained below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming videos from Windows XP to the Xbox with manually re-encoded files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming videos from Windows Vista Media Center to the Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing videos on TiVo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using my PowerBook plugged directly into the TV to play movies using Front Row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 is designed to talk to any Windows XP machine using Media Player 11, or to Windows Media Center. You use different areas of the Xbox menus to access either of these two, and they have some differences and similarities. If you are connecting to plain Media Player, say for Videos, then you access a &amp;ldquo;Videos&amp;rdquo; item on the Xbox and it connects to the PC and shows a flat list of videos. Here are a few reasons that this seemingly futuristic capability completely sucks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Xbox can only play movies in WMV format, which is very rarely used anywhere. This means that almost any video you already have, and any TV show you download from the internet, is in the wrong format to play on the Xbox. But let&amp;rsquo;s pretend for a minute that you&amp;rsquo;ve converted everything to this format, as there are other things that suck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The video listing you get is a flat list with no playlists or other organizing schemes, and only the filename is shown, with no way to give it a piece of metadata like a title. This just does not scale to even 3 seasons of TV shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you play a video, you cannot resume playback to a previously-viewed point. You have to fastforward to where you were. This is a typical Microsoft UI oversight, and we ran into this issue approximately EVERY DAY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To populate this list in the first place, you must share your Windows Media Player 11 library using &amp;ldquo;media sharing&amp;rdquo;. This seemed cool at first, since I thought that like iTunes, your library would be shared, since that&amp;rsquo;s what the name says. Nope. None of your playlists are shared &lt;em&gt;for videos&lt;/em&gt;, only your audio playlists. Instead, only the videos that live inside so-called &amp;ldquo;Watched Folders&amp;rdquo; are shared. This means you have to get Media Player to monitor a folder and have it always add any new files to your library. To me, the purpose of a media library is so that I can carefully catalog my personal media files, not use it as a dumping-ground of all files. On top of this, of course it does not work properly, so that when I had a new folder with 10 video files in a monitored location, only 8 of them would appear automatically, and I had to add the last two manually. Wow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back and discuss WMV. When you convert one type of media encoding to another, it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;re-encoding.&amp;rdquo; So one must re-encode any movie in Xvid of Divx format (e.g. all downloaded TV shows) into WMV. There is a program called TVersity that comes really close to making this problem disappear. What it does is let you add any movie files to its list, and this list appears on the Xbox under the Videos area. So one cool thing is that it&amp;rsquo;s simulating the media sharing feature of Media Player. But what&amp;rsquo;s even cooler is that it will serve the Xbox an on-the-fly re-encoded WMV stream instead of the original file. This lets you have lots of Xvid files around, but the Xbox can still play them. Here are the disappointments of this setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot fastforward or rewind in a stream. So basically you can pause your videos, or stop them and restart from the beginning. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Not too flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My PC (an Athlon XP 2500+) is evidently too slow to do all this in real time, despite playing with the setttings. So there were always 5-10 pauses per half-hour show, of 30 seconds each, each of which ended up skipping over a few seconds of video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage (I&amp;rsquo;m progressing chronologically through my experiments in this narrative), I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to just re-encode a given season of a TV show we were watching all at once into WMV using some tool, and then stream these using media sharing. So I found a tool called Encode360 that has the Xbox in mind, and I started to re-encode. Here were the disappointments of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three flavors of WMV. The best quality is offered by so-called WVC1, but to encode a 30 minute show in this format took about 90 minutes. Moreover, after doing two or three shows, Encode360 would crash, and so what should have finished in a day or so took me a week of restarting jobs before work and before going to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use the lower levels of WMV quality, you have to up the bitrate to get watchable video. But bitrate is directly proportional to file size, and so a 300MB Xvid file would become a 1GB WMV file. And since I want to keep the Xvid original, that&amp;rsquo;s 1.3G per half-hour show!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Media Center. You can think of it as a special version of Media Player that looks great on a TV and is easy to navigate with a remote control. It connects to a Media Center PC which itself runs a very similar-looking full-screen interface. Basically the Media Center PC streams all its data to the Xbox, so it becomes another way to view videos, music and photos. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really solve any of the above problems with encoding, since the Xbox still needs WMV format movies even inside Media Center. But if I were to re-encode all the movies myself (maybe by finding a better tool than Encode360) then maybe I could at least have a better organized interface for browsing playlists and having real Title metadata. Also, there&amp;rsquo;s a plugin for Media Center that does what TVersity does (re-encode to WMV on the fly), but it crashed Media Center the first time I tried it. I like the Media Center interface, and if it let me organize movies I guess that would make me happy. But I still need to do all that re-encoding work, which I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more item on Media Center. It also shares photos and music to the Xbox, but its whole metaphor for photos is just stupid old hard drive folders and filenames. We have tools like iPhoto on the Mac and Picasa on Windows now, that have transcended this old model by light-years. What about storing photos in albums? Or giving them Titles instead of filenames? Or giving them other metadata like tags and comments? None of this is in Media Center from what I could see. We have to keep everything organized by folder and filename, which is not where metadata should live. Lastly, if you use an iPod and buy music from iTunes, then the music sharing is not useful to you, since it can&amp;rsquo;t play protected iTunes music, nor can it see your iTunes playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning now, I have two friends at work who swear by Media Center. When I complained about my woes with the Xbox, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t relate 100% because their setups are different in one key way: They have their PCs in their living rooms, directly connected to the home theater. They have so-called HTPCs (Home Theater PCs), and so they can play whatever video formats they want, since the Xbox is not involved. If you want one of these, then you need a new computer. But if you&amp;rsquo;re going to go to that trouble, why not get a Mac Mini, which has Front Row, a similar piece of software to Media Center. I decided to try this by installing Front Row on my Powerbook, hooking it up to the TV, and seeing what was possible. Here are the wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can play any video file (MPEG, Xvid, Divx), since now you&amp;rsquo;re using a Real Computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can play iTunes music, including using actual, real library sharing from the iTunes library on my PC (the main repository of music in our house)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can see my iPhoto library, which I don&amp;rsquo;t use since the photos are on our PC, so it&amp;rsquo;s not so useful to me, but iPhoto is better than flat folders and files, so it wins in principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can add videos to iTunes and give them Title metadata rather than use filenames. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to find out if I can make playlists of videos. To do any of this, you need to use QuickTime to make a so-called &amp;ldquo;reference movie&amp;rdquo;, which is a small file that a) can be added to iTunes, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept .avi files directly and b) refers to the original and plays it, saving the space of a full re-encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interface is nice of course, but comparably nice versus Media Center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can view video podcasts, something Media Player cannot do without third-party add-ins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a breakthrough when I tried it using my PowerBook. I still kept all the movie files on my PC, and used file sharing to play them over the network. If I buy an inexpensive Mac Mini, I can make it its own component in my home theater and use Front Row all the time. If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering where Apple TV fits into this, it would provide a &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; setup to a Mac Mini for less money, but it can only play MPEG4 and QuickTIme movies, which puts you in a re-encoding situation similar to the Xbox. But at least MPEG4 is a real open format with lots of tools available, unlike WMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo was a nonstarter by the way, since although it can connect to a PC to play files, it can only play TiVo MPEG2 files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when it comes to recording TV shows over cable TV or satellite, you have another set of choices. Media Center and TiVo both do this, but not Front Row or Apple TV. If you want to record HD, you need to either buy a $2,000 HTPC or an $800 TiVo Series 3. When the Series 3 drops in price, I&amp;rsquo;ll consider getting one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Korsun Pocket</title>
      <link>/2006/12/korsun-pocket/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2006 19:40:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2006/12/korsun-pocket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve bought my first computer wargame, called &lt;em&gt;Korsun Pocket&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matrixgames.com&#34;&gt;Matrix Games&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to share a short section from the manual, because it gets me pretty excited to play and so I thought it would be a good illustration to share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Front - January 1944.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another severe Russian winter and months of devastating retreats have forced Manstein&amp;rsquo;s
once mighty Army Group South to its knees. Weakened by innumerable losses and defeats, the 8th Army and 1st Panzer Army desperately defend a tenuous portion of the Dnieper River in a salient 50 kilometres west of the city of Cherkassy. OKH demands this portion of river be held as the bridgehead for a renewed summer offensive - an offensive that would never - &lt;em&gt;could never&lt;/em&gt; - materialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salient invites encirclement and on January 24th and 25th the Soviets happily oblige. Fuelled
by their enormous victories the previous summer, five full armies of mechanised and Armored troops of the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts burst through the tired German defence creating the first major encirclement since Stalingrad the previous winter. Their objective? To surround and crush the German forces against the River Dnieper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flawed strategy only too familiar to his weary generals, Hitler refuses a withdrawal and by doing so, seems to seal the fate of yet another army. Within 4 days the Russians link up near the town of Lysyanko, trapping the German XLII and XI Army Korps, a pocket of 60,000
troops, behind enemy lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centred on the city of Korsun, the forlorn Germans are forced to fight for their lives with only a minor airfield to sustain them. They are trapped without hope of surviving, destined for the POW cages east of the Urals. Or are they? Amongst the trapped units is the mighty 5th SS Wiking Division and they are not going to go down without a fight&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korsun Pocket recreates the formation of that pocket, and the desperate German attempts to relieve it in the
days that followed. Players control brigade, regimental and battalion sized units on a map spanning more than 28,500 km2, manoeuvring and fighting with the historical units present in the campaign. Off-board support, air interdiction and
replacements are all faithfully recreated to assist the player in his quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s five scenarios cover the most exciting aspects of the battle and include a full campaign game which allows you to re-fight the entire battle. A series of fictional tutorial scenarios take you through the game mechanics and are highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you as the Soviet Commander
create and defeat the German pocket before strong panzer reinforcements intervene?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As German Commander, can you obey your
Fuhrer&amp;rsquo;s orders and hang on to the Dnieper against all odds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this gets me excited is because I stand to learn a great deal about military strategy and tactics, as well as gaining a more detailed context for my understanding of the 20th century&amp;rsquo;s wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new World War I game coming soon, also from Matrix (they&amp;rsquo;re the publisher, not the developer), called &lt;em&gt;The Guns of August&lt;/em&gt;, which I will definitely also get, since currently I&amp;rsquo;ve read more about that war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interest in the World Wars, and my recent reading of &lt;em&gt;The Guns of August&lt;/em&gt; (Tuchman), led me somehow to look into the wargaming universe. I learned that there is of course a sizable community of computer wargamers and developers, and I took a look around the landscape and selected a few to zero in on. Some of these are on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shelfcentered.com/index.php?event=user_shelf&amp;amp;userid=26&amp;amp;user_shelf=Christmas%202006&#34;&gt;Christmas shelf&lt;/a&gt;, and some I pirated so I could read the manual and get a feel for how it goes.  It turns out the more detailed ones are more appealing so far, such as the one pictured above, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matrixgames.com/games/game.asp?gid=317&#34;&gt;The Operational Art of War III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;d like to do is to get familiar with the mechanics and idioms of the genre, and then play through some WWI and WWII scenarios to see if it really adds some depth to my understanding of the great battles of the last century.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently heard of a book called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670034894/ref=nosim/002-6749880-5641633?n=283155&#34;&gt;The Jasons&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=376&#34;&gt;the blog of a former colleague&lt;/a&gt;, Peter Woit. Since I spent the summer of 2004 doing classified math research for the government, I was very interested to hear of another such group. In a way, the Jasons are a sequel to the very successful Manhattan Project, and there is lots of overlap of personnel. The Jasons came into being in the aftermath of the Soviet launch of Sputnik, in 1960 to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying the book on a recent visit to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ciweb.org&#34;&gt;Chautauqua Institution&lt;/a&gt;, I was fascinated to read that in their very early years, they invented an idea that today is revolutionizing astronomy: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics&#34;&gt;adaptive optics&lt;/a&gt;. By coincidence, this technique was just starting to move its way to the front of my mind, because I try to keep up with astronomy news, due to my lifelong interest in the subject. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to happen upon it in the quite different context of the Jasons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intelligent Design: The Final Word, Part 3</title>
      <link>/2006/03/intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2006 21:53:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2006/03/intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The central question I have been trying to satisfy myself about with these notes is the following: is there a way to formulate Intelligent Design as a scientific theory? (See &lt;a href=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/?p=61&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/?p=62&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition, a scientific theory is a model of a part of the world that makes verifiable and falsifiable predictions about specific observations. To answer this question, I will reformulate the statement of ID. Behe&amp;rsquo;s formulation looks like this (this is not a quote, I&amp;rsquo;m summing up his argument):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My summary of Behe&amp;rsquo;s argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say up front that I am not going to attack the probability part of this argument in order to argue whether it is scientific. It is perfectly reasonable to say that something we observe has a very low probability of arising from some process, and to remove evidence from the applicability of that process in so doing. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you can demonstrate what that probability is. In a further essay I will look at this issue more closely, but only when I want to discuss the &lt;em&gt;correctness&lt;/em&gt; of ID, not whether it is  a scientific theory in the first place, which is our current aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to reformulate the statement above summarizing Behe a couple times to draw out out what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. I expect that an ID enthusiast will object to my reformulations at some point because the conclusion will follow immediately from the final reformulation, but I wonder where the objections will arise exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformulation 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now add to the discussion that I fully grant that all of Behe&amp;rsquo;s examples are in fact irreducibly complex, which simply means that the systems involve several interacting parts without any one of which the system fails to function. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple to define concept, and surely his examples are all in fact irreducibly complex. Granted. Now, also losing the bit about probability, we can reformulate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformulation 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;entirely equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to Behe&amp;rsquo;s statement of ID, once you remove the question about whether the systems are irreducibly complex, and replacing the caveat about probability with the blank statement &amp;ldquo;cannot explain.&amp;rdquo; If you agree with the complexity part, then all ID says is that evolution cannot explain this complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with ID is that this not the statement of a scientific theory. It is the contradiction of one, namely of evolution. It only makes one prediction, that evolution will not be able to explain irreducible complexity. The only way to study this idea is to study the evolution of molecular systems and try to explain how the irreducible complexity of some particular system came to be. See, ID doesn&amp;rsquo;t substitute anything for evolution, it merely fills the gap it creates with the Designer. It cannot make any new predictions, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an analogous scenario. The 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock news reports that there are crop circles on a farm outside town. A scientist on TV expresses his theory that it is the work of teenagers playing a prank. Another scientist puts forward the theory that the crop circles cannot be explained as the work of humans, they must be the work of extraterrestrials. Furthermore, the second scientist argues that his theory is just as scientific as the first theory, because they both purport to explain a particular phenomenon. The problem with the second theory is that its central claim is that the first claim is wrong, and in so doing it creates a gap, which it then fills with extraterrestrials. But the gap is not a theory, just the contradiction of one. The way to proceed to investigate crop circles, then, is to pursue the first theory and try to find a natural explanation. That&amp;rsquo;s the same course of action we&amp;rsquo;d take if there was no second theory. And of course crop circles were eventually found to be easily made by teenagers using planks of wood with rope handles to press down the crops in just a few hours overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same with ID. The way to pursue this issue is to investigate natural ways that these irreducibly complex systems may have come about. That&amp;rsquo;s the same approach we&amp;rsquo;d take if there was no ID theory. ID theory adds nothing and makes no claims other than to contradict an existing line of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that ID is falsifiable. Finding a viable evolutionary path for the cilium or any of the systems Behe is interested in will falsify ID, and Behe himself points this out. That&amp;rsquo;s an important point, because when I started this line of thinking I assumed I&amp;rsquo;d be determining that ID isn&amp;rsquo;t falsifiable. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned instead is that ID isn&amp;rsquo;t predictive. No theory whose statement can be summarized as &amp;ldquo;that other theory over there won&amp;rsquo;t work in this case&amp;rdquo; is predictive. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any claims of its own that can be tested, and so the only way to investigate it is to investigate the original theory, making the contradictory theory actually meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this tell us about teaching ID in science classes? My short answer is that since it is not a scientific theory, it should not be taught. It certainly should not be required, and probably its absence should be required. But why? Because science is about skepticism, model-building and model-testing. It&amp;rsquo;s never about authority, never about personal preferences. It makes no contact with our political or spiritual structures. It is completely confined, completely focused on material predictions that can be tested and falsified. Theories that limit the domain of science, the way ID claims science will never apply to certain biological systems, may or may not be correct. But science does not place such limitiations on itself, for to do so is impossible within the framework of science. Scientists will be the first to admit that they have a poor understanding of how evolution applies to sub-cellular systems. Science demands such concessions &amp;ndash; science &lt;em&gt;is the requirement&lt;/em&gt; to make such concessions. And that state of affairs may continue to hold for a million years for all I know. It does not change the central point, that science is a process for adding to the accuracy of our models, not for defining boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intelligent Design: The Final Word, Part 2</title>
      <link>/2006/03/intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2006 21:32:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2006/03/intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my discussion of ID (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/?p=61&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;). Here in part 2 I have exerpted from Behe&amp;rsquo;s book in order to summarize his argument. I am using the 2003 trade paperback edition published by Free Press, lent to me by a work colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ID argument in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For discrete physical systems &amp;mdash; if there is not a gradual route to their production &amp;mdash; design is evident when a number of separate, interacting components are ordered in such a way as to accomplish a function beyond the individual components.&amp;rdquo; (p. 194)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because the functions depend critically on the intricate interactions of the parts we must conclude that they, like a mousetrap, were designed.&amp;rdquo; (p. 205)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular for the cilium, a system used by cells for movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The function of the cilium is to be a motorized paddle. In order to achieve this function microtubules, nexin linkers, and motor proteins all have to be ordered in a precise fashion. They have to recognize each other intimately, and interact exactly. The function is not present if any of the components is missing.&amp;rdquo; (p. 204)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the identity of the designer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Inferences to design do not require that we have a candidate for the role of designer.&amp;rdquo; (p. 196)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the falsifiability of ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Might there be an as-yet-undiscovered natural process that would explain biochemical complexity? No one would be foolish enough to categorically deny the possibility. Nonetheless, we can say that if there is such a process, no one has a clue how it would work. Further, it would go against all human experience, like postulating that a natural process might explain computers. Concluding that no such process exists is as scientifically sound as concluding that mental telepathy is not possible, or that the Loch Ness monster doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. In the face of the massive evidence we do have for biochemical design, ignoring that evidence in the name of a phantom process would be to play the role of the detectives who ignore an elephant.&amp;rdquo; (p. 203-204)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the testability of ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hypothesis, careful testing, replicability &amp;ndash; all these have served science well. But how can an intelligent designer be tested? Can a designer be put in a test tube? No, of course not. But neither can extinct common ancestors be put in test tubes. The problem is that whenever science tries to explain a unique historical event, careful testing and replicability are by definition impossible. Science may be able to study the motion of modern comets, and test Newton&amp;rsquo;s laws of motion that describe how the comets move. But science will never be able to study the comet that putatively struck the earth many millions of years ago. Science can, however, observe the comet&amp;rsquo;s lingering &lt;em&gt;effects&lt;/em&gt; on the modern earth. Similarly, science can see the effects that a designer has had on life.&amp;rdquo; (emphasis in the original) (p. 242-243)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Intelligent Design: The Final Word, Part 1</title>
      <link>/2006/03/intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2006 20:59:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2006/03/intelligent-design-the-final-word-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally ready to write some definitive thoughts about Intelligent Design. I just finished reading Michael Behe&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;Darwin&amp;rsquo;s Black Box&lt;/em&gt; from 1996, and I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it from the perspective of science, falsifiability, religion, and philosophy. I would like to be very careful about where I plan and do not plan to take issue with him, so let me start in Part 1 by delineating the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the eponymous designer of ID need not be divine, says Behe, and I agree completely. It could be an alien species, or something way beyond our understanding, but non-divine. ID is not inherently theological. So this discussion will have nothing whatsoever to do with God or religion. Religious folks may want ID to become a political movement so they can impose their views into everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives, but that is the problem of those religious folks, and does not bear on ID&amp;rsquo;s validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I will not contest any of Behe&amp;rsquo;s descriptions of various biochemical systems. The cilium, blood clotting, etc., are all assumed to work the way he describes, &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;ldquo;irreducible complexity&amp;rdquo; of these systems (more on that in later parts, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both agree, further, that the earth is 5 billion years old, that Darwinian evolution does in fact take place in many domains (including the descent of man from a common ancestor with apes, the origin of new species, all that good stuff). ID does not deny these things, so we needn&amp;rsquo;t discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both reject the counterargument to ID that goes like this: If an intelligent designer designed our cilia, or our blood clotting system, or our eyes, then he could have made them more efficient/effective/symmetric/beautiful or whatever, and so they were not designed. This argument requires an understanding of the motivation of the designer, as well as a claim to completely understand all the tradeoffs involved in the functioning of these systems, which no one has. We will not be discussing this argument further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any new scientific theory will be treated with skepticism, and ID touches religious nerves which makes this an especially complicated issue to deal with. I am not going to make the mistake of dismissing ID based on my own concerns about the political ramifications, or the granting of power to religious interests. I am attempting to understand Behe&amp;rsquo;s arguments on his terms. I want to know whether ID can be a truly testable, falsifiable scientific theory that stands on its own. I want to understand this because if it passes this test, then I invite it to be taught in science classrooms. If it fails this test, then I will join the fight to keep it out of the science classroom, where it can do no good and can do quite a bit of harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few further clarifications are in order. I am not making the assumption that science is a good system. I am not requiring you to agree that science enhances our sense of wonder and of the divine. I do not claim that scientists are automatically benevolent, or are smarter than anyone else. I am not claiming that scientists should be the sole trustees of ethical decisions concerning technology. I am not trying to pass a value judgment on science itself, in other words. I may do so in future writings, but I am leaving it out of the discussion of ID. I am only studying a very narrow question:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this down for a long time. There are two very widespread and very annoying idioms that I see a lot in amateur writing. The main example of the kind of writing I mean is product reviews on sites like Amazon, but I see it also on Macworld, CNet and other more professional sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the word &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; as in &amp;ldquo;this little device from Apple,&amp;rdquo; or even worse, &amp;ldquo;this little gem from Apple.&amp;rdquo;  There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with it really, it&amp;rsquo;s just hugely overused, and I&amp;rsquo;m oversensitive to triteness.  The second phrase is &amp;ldquo;a winner,&amp;rdquo; as in &amp;ldquo;this telescope is a real winner.&amp;rdquo;  Both phrases are frequently found together, as in &amp;ldquo;This little gem from Apple is a definite winner!&amp;rdquo;  Cut it out, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m here, let me point out one more horribly annoying habit: listing three things and then saying &amp;ldquo;oh my.&amp;rdquo;  This is hugely common in cutesy computer publications like Macworld, as in &amp;ldquo;iPods and iTunes and iMacs, oh my!&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s not funny, and you probably already used the joke six times a year for the last five years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I just an ass who likes to find flaws in other people, so that I can dismiss them?  Probably.  But I also think that the best writers are probably aware of pitfalls like these and strive to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790733226/104-8979811-4830322?v=glance&amp;amp;n=130&amp;amp;n=507846&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;v=glance&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; again for the first time in a while. A major theme of the movie is that the goals of science and religion are so hard to untangle that the two main protagonists have a very complicated adult relationship based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current context of the debate about religion in the science classroom, I think about my own feelings about science quite a bit. Far from feeling that science and religion are incompatible, I actually feel that they are two sides of the same coin.  I mean, think about it. How often do people&amp;rsquo;s deeply held, innermost core beliefs actually tend to be different?  Can we really believe that, given the size of the universe (which I guess you&amp;rsquo;ll have to grant me) and all the diversity of our planet, that two of us humans could really be all that &lt;em&gt;tremendously&lt;/em&gt; different in our innermost models of what our purpose is in the universe? OF COURSE SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE THE SAME THING, HOW COULD THEY NOT BE? WE&amp;rsquo;RE ALL PEOPLE, WE ALL WANT THE SAME THINGS AND WE ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that a more sophisticated dialogue is going on somewhere in the world, and that it spreads to this country.  In particular, I wish that some religious representatives would realize that pursuing science is a way of appreciating the Universe, or God, or Nature, or whatever Large Thing you care to call it.  If God did create the Universe, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he want us to understand all the wonders he created?  Is it sinful to break apart an atom and see what God made inside the atom?  Far from it, it&amp;rsquo;s an expression of wonder to pursue such knowledge.  If you interviewed all the scientists who do stuff like that, you&amp;rsquo;d find many or most of them are on a search for something larger than themselves, a way to be connected to the Universe.  Listen to the moving speech that Jodie Foster&amp;rsquo;s character gives to James Woods&amp;rsquo; character and his committee at the end of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Irrational Design?</title>
      <link>/2005/10/irrational-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2005 22:00:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2005/10/irrational-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a great deal of controversy at the moment over Intelligent Design (ID) being taught in science classrooms. I have always felt very strongly about the dangers faced by science in our society, and this crisis is a perfect example of what can happen without careful vigilance on the part of science teachers and practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be trying to understand this issue thoroughly in the coming months, though I must admit my conclusion is rather clear in advance. Nonetheless, I believe there are subtle arguments being made in ID, and if I am truly worried about the role of science in my society, then I owe it to my children to understand the debate completely, so that I can be an informed participant in any future discussions that involve my district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main themes I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping in mind as I read are: is ID a purely religious point of view?  Is ID a &amp;ldquo;God of the Gaps&amp;rdquo; argument?  Can a falsifiable scientific theory of ID exist?  Are our children being taught that science produces facts rather than theories?  Are our children being taught that science and religion cannot coexist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be getting to these questions over time.  At the moment, I want to say something about science to get the ball rolling.  Science is many things, but right now I feel especially protective of its adherence to &lt;em&gt;falsifiability&lt;/em&gt;. Any scientific statement or prediction must be testable against nature, and such tests must be able to either confirm or contradict the statement. When Einstein proposed the theory of General Relativity, it was known right away that its predictions of the movement of bodies did not vary very much from the Newtonian formulation of gravity. If Einstein had been unable to think of an experiment or observation that would be able to confirm or contradict his theory with respect to Newton&amp;rsquo;s, then the scientific community would have rejected General Relativity completely.  Einstein and Sir Arthur Eddington were able, however, to use GR to predict an observed anomoly in the orbit of Mercury that had previously gone unexplained.  Moreover, they were able to use GR to predict the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, and observe such lensing during a solar eclipse.  Once these observations were made and proved to be consistent with GR to great precision, GR became the new working theory of gravity.  If we make an observation tomorrow that is inconsistent with GR, and in some sense we already have because quantum theory is known to be incompatible, then we will start looking for a better theory that explains everything explained by GR and also the inconsistent observations.  Science does not hold any given theory dear, and each one is always ready to be rejected as soon as it fails.  The system only works if falsifiability is held as the highest goal. Skepticism, peer review, and measurements against nature are the tools of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me extend this idea to science &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;. We should teach only scientific theories in science class.  This means two things.  First, no non-falsifiable theories need apply.  Those are not testable by science, and so they lie outside the domain.  They are as irrelevant in science class as anything can be.  It would be the same as requiring students to learn to tell fortunes with Tarot cards in history class.  Secondly, we must be very careful in how we teach science.  I suspect that many teachers do not give students the impression that scientific theories can be overthrown, or how that happens.  Rather, they teach theories as if they were final facts.  Gravity &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the curvature of spacetime.  Electrons &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; orbit the nucleus in fixed orbitals that are physically real.  Galaxies &lt;em&gt;definitely have&lt;/em&gt; black holes at the center.  The universe &lt;em&gt;definitely started&lt;/em&gt; with the Big Bang.  Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that every sentence like these needs to be qualified with &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;, we think&amp;rdquo; every time you say them, so long as you spend a good amount of class time explaining that everything is just a working model. Science does not claim that the world really works in certain ways.  Rather, it is a process for better modeling the world, and it requires certain criteria in order for the forward movement to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if ID is not falsifiable, that&amp;rsquo;s the only piece of information I need to decide if it should be taught in science class.  Others like to discuss how religious Newton was, or how uncertain of natural selection so-and-so actual practiciing biologist is.  None of this matters.  Every falsifiable theory of biology that explains all the known facts should be taught in science class, and nothing more.  If someone says &amp;ldquo;God created some of our biochemical machinery,&amp;rdquo; then I&amp;rsquo;m very interested to hear their argument, but not in science class.  It can never be proved wrong, because we will never know what &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; happened in the past, and so it gets science nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac Moments 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My second Mac moment came when using the text editor TextWrangler to work on ShelfCentered.com. Yesterday I had put my Mac on mute for some reason, and of course I forgot about it and was working away this evening. I was searching a document for occurrences of a word, and there were none. Now, usually this would produce the usual audible beep. But the developers of TextWrangler included a feature that automatically detected my Mac was on mute, and instead popped a message up on the screen that said &amp;ldquo;Not Found.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t even really notice how wonderful this was until a minute later, because I just received the information and proceeded accordingly. I managed to capture the message before it faded out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/wp-content/my_images/TextWranglerVisual.png&#34; alt=&#34;Textwranglervisual&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is a perfect illustration of how the Mac philosophy of excellent user interface design has historically also been reflected by Mac developers. Bare Bones (who make this text editor) has a long history on the Mac, and are well loved as a result. There is &lt;strong&gt;care&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;foresight&lt;/strong&gt; reflected in this interface element. And it is not eye candy or useless feature bloat, either. When the volume is muted, how can the user be notified that the command has successfully been received, but there are no text matches? To ask the question is to seek more depth in your interface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac Moments</title>
      <link>/2005/05/mac-moments/</link>

      <guid>/2005/05/mac-moments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At my workplace, the Mac platform is often derided by what I consider typical &amp;ldquo;PC guys.&amp;rdquo; These are technically savvy folks who for whatever reason feel very strongly that the Mac platform is poor, or should go away, or that Windows has definitively proven its superiority. Sometimes these same people are also very skeptical of Microsoft, but usually not. It&amp;rsquo;s strange, though, that someone can feel so ambivalent about Microsoft yet so strongly negative about the Mac. Recently, the success of the iPod has served to greatly increase the bitterness and spite felt towards the Mac by such people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, since I&amp;rsquo;m often asked at work, &amp;ldquo;Why do you love the Mac so much,&amp;rdquo; I decided to try to answer it. I am unable to give detailed reasons on the spot, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d keep it in the back of my mind, and blog about it when something occurred to me. Besides, most of my reasons are very mundane and subtle interface design issues that sort of accumulate in my mind into a positive feeling over time. When one of these small things happens, rather than let it fall through the cracks, I hoped to catch it for a segment I call &amp;ldquo;Mac Moments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding to the Moment, let me add that I am also a heavy user of Windows and Linux. There are great things about all three platforms, and I&amp;rsquo;m a competent user of all of them. I own a fast PC because I like playing the latest games, which is the same reason I own an Xbox and a GameCube. I don&amp;rsquo;t hate Windows, in fact I think I have the most balanced opinion on the pros and cons of these systems of anyone I know! But of course, look who&amp;rsquo;s telling me that. Okay, I hope that addressed any fears you may have had that I&amp;rsquo;m a serious Mac zealot. On to the Moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first Mac Moment is very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Mac OS, when you Command-click on the titlebar of a window that&amp;rsquo;s not in the foreground, you can move that window around without bringing it forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, there was a progress dialog for a movie file I was processing in the background, and I was working in a text editor in the foreground. I wanted to slide it to the right a bit in order to see more of the progress bar, so I could monitor the progress while I worked. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bring the whole movie application forward, I only wanted to move a background window. On the Mac, I&amp;rsquo;m able to perform this common, mundane task. On Windows, there is no such thing as modified clicks on window frames. Any click will bring the window forward. In the worst case, this can be expensive, causing a redraw of the window as it comes forward, and then another redraw when you switch back to what you were doing. Moreover, if you were working in Word or a text editor like I was, the click to bring your work back to the front might move the cursor from where you were working, forcing you to reposition it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this is a small issue. But over the course of years, you come to appreciate the extra thought that went into the Mac. A Windows user typically doesn&amp;rsquo;t even recognize that this sort of user-centric way of working even exists. Basically, a Mac user expects the machine to work the way they do, while a PC user is expected to mold themselves to the machine. We&amp;rsquo;re so used to doing that sort of adapting these days that we come to expect it. But it&amp;rsquo;s not just I who expect more &amp;ndash; many others do as well, and all it takes is a little more brainpower when designing the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had poker on my mind since last Thanksgiving, specifically Texas Hold&amp;rsquo;em. At this point, I have special hold&amp;rsquo;em software, four poker strategy books and one nonfiction book about poker. I mostly study the books and play a bit with the software, but eventually I want to start a real-money account on one of the online poker sites. I feel that if I apply what&amp;rsquo;s in the books, then I can win money, which would be a very fun goal to shoot for. Of course, to avoid having a gambling problem I have to tread very carefully and lower my expectations within reason for the early stages. I have been procrastinating setting up a new checking account for my poker money both because I truly hesitate to take this step, and because I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I&amp;rsquo;m good enough yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poker sites all offer games with pretend money, but the problem there is the opponents are so crazy and bad that you can hardly apply any real strategy. The poker software offers a good challenge, but it&amp;rsquo;s almost to the other extreme &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s designed to provide challenging opponents. This is a good thing, but the kind of opponents I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to win money from are inbetween: they&amp;rsquo;re better than lunatics, but they won&amp;rsquo;t play like a typical strong opponent. They&amp;rsquo;ll play too many hands and go too far with them. If I can tune my poker software to simulate this, maybe I can grow more confident and eventually open that bank account. I&amp;rsquo;m sure my friends and family will all be equally horrified by this (my wife doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to discuss it with me), but I still feel like it&amp;rsquo;s something I should try.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2005/04/shelfcentered.com/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a new side project that my wife, brother and sister and I came up with, called ShelfCentered.com. I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted about ShelfCentered.com as of yet, because honestly I suspect it might be a good enough idea to really become something good, and I want to protect us from competitors! For example, there are a couple of shareware programs out there already that do what we&amp;rsquo;re planning, and they&amp;rsquo;ve created some limited buzz, but so far no one has thought to put the idea online in a nice web site. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail just yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to maintain a blog without mentioning the thing that&amp;rsquo;s my primary occupation outside work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden has been on me to get the site off the ground, but once it&amp;rsquo;s to a certain point the rest of the family will be able to help out more. I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to get enough mental traction, but now I think I&amp;rsquo;m getting somewhere. As always, it was a combination of gathering the right set of tools, and being organized enough to start drawing some specifications. There was a longish period of experimentation with a particular application of Web Services as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the tools I&amp;rsquo;m using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My PowerBook is the primary development machine, because it has the Unix environment that imitates our web host, and I can develop around the house. All the items below are installed both on my &amp;lsquo;Book and on our server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; (comes with Mac OS X)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php.net&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; (comes with Mac OS X)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mysql.com&#34;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smarty.php.net&#34;&gt;Smarty&lt;/a&gt;. This is the most interesting part. It will let me separate the display of the data on the site from the PHP code that fetches it from Web Services or the local database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml&#34;&gt;TextWrangler&lt;/a&gt;. (This is only on my Mac.) This is the free version of BBEdit. It can parse PHP to give me a function popup, and has a great drawer feature where the files I&amp;rsquo;m working with are listed without window clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>MathML</title>
      <link>/2005/04/mathml/</link>

      <guid>/2005/04/mathml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend and former coworker, Robert Miner, has written an article about MathML in the latest issue of Notices of the American Mathematics Society, which you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ams.org/notices/200505/fea-miner.pdf&#34;&gt;read online&lt;/a&gt; [pdf]. MathML is a standard XML representation of math notation and semantics, and has been adopted steadily ever since Robert co-created it in 1998.  When I worked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dessci.com&#34;&gt;Design Science&lt;/a&gt; with Robert, MathML was becoming a major focus for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see this article, because the academic math community is still very focused on TeX/LaTeX, which are fine as far as they go, but somewhat old-fashioned and limited compared to MathML.  TeX is strictly for presentation, for example, and conveys no semantic content. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t paste TeX into a computer algebra system, for example, and expect it to compute anything.  MathML is a better, more general solution, and has other benefits Robert covers in the article. One likely future application is the ability to index and search math formulas, something I began working on with Robert towards the end of my tenure at Design Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the math community becomes more aware of this technology and begins to adopt it. Nice work, Robert!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daylight Savings Time</title>
      <link>/2005/04/daylight-savings-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2005 05:16:35 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2005/04/daylight-savings-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand daylight savings time. No one I talk to has a clear idea of when and why it was invented. What country started it?  What countries adhere to it?  Why is Europe still doing it a week before the US?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear to me that having extremely accurate measurements of time has become an indispensible part of our society.  Computers and many other timekeeping devices are synchronized regularly with servers maintained by (or synchronized with) our standards bodies&amp;rsquo; equipment, so that their inherent inaccuracy can be overcome.  Very nearly, there is one nearly standard idea of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, do we have this sloppy period where times start changing all over the world.  At the company where I work, we have employees everywhere with whom we meet regularly by phone.  One of them works from Morocco, and we missed a meeting with him last week because he had already gone to daylight savings time and we hadn&amp;rsquo;t, and we all forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not so much that this really bothers me, because I don&amp;rsquo;t care if we have a somewhat loose notion of time &amp;amp;emdash; when we make it too strict, I start to feel a bit dehumanized.  Rather, what I find interesting is that we&amp;rsquo;re so inconsistent.  We seem obsessed with the exact microsecond of time, and we do all we can to get univeral agreement among our devices, at least &lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;, while at the same time we don&amp;rsquo;t keep very good track of the hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this was an overly elaborate way to link to a CNN story (via Slashdot) about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/07/daylight.saving.ap/index.html&#34;&gt;Congress considering extending Daylight Savings Time by a couple of months&lt;/a&gt;. That would make eight months of DST out of twelve.  Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that sound strange?  It drives home how arbitrary time is anyway &amp;ndash; why not call the other four months &amp;ldquo;Daylight Wastings Time&amp;rdquo;?  When I saw the headline mention changing DST, I assumed they were trying to do away with it!  I assumed that the confusion and loss of maximal human efficiency caused by the change would be declared to be a drag on our economy or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are reasons it seems DST is a good idea.  I guess it saves energy to move the daylight hours around.  That&amp;rsquo;s all fine and good, but do it everywhere in the world at once, or else let&amp;rsquo;s just admit we don&amp;rsquo;t really care what time it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C. S. Lewis 2005</title>
      <link>/2005/01/c.-s.-lewis-2005/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2005 01:39:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2005/01/c.-s.-lewis-2005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I visited my parents for the holidays again this year, and like last year I decided to read some of their C. S. Lewis collection. I felt like progressing on with his Christian works, and so I chose &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, there are good, simple explanations of many points of Christian doctrine that I rarely heard explained in Catholic school.  Without fully admitting it to myself, however, I was looking for something specific.  Namely, I was looking for more material like that which I found to be  compelling in &lt;em&gt;The Great Divorce&lt;/em&gt;, describing what it might be like to really surrender to a certain impulse. In Lewis&amp;rsquo; mind this is the religious, specifically Christian impulse, to be one with God. In my mind, I&amp;rsquo;d rather not say it&amp;rsquo;s religious, but yet I know exactly what he&amp;rsquo;s talking about.  I am familiar with trying to improve myself, and also with failing to do so. I am familiar with many doubts and fears, and I also perceive that it is possible to defeat all of these with a single choice. That choice is simply to give them up and stop having the doubts and fears. The funny thing is, though, that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to give them up.  We feel very possessive of these feelings because they are part of our identity. I enjoy very much reading about this idea, because it gives me glimpses into what life might be like after such a surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One point he makes that stood out for me is in the chapter called &amp;ldquo;Is Christianity Hard or Easy?&amp;rdquo;  Lewis describes a misconception, which I can relate to. The misconception is that we sometimes feel like obeying morality is something we hope we can do some of, and then when we&amp;rsquo;re done, there will be time left over for ourselves, to do the things we want to do. Not evil things, just things that aren&amp;rsquo;t so wrapped up with morality, like watching a movie, say. We hold back that little piece; our own personal agenda is more important, but we will try to make decisions consistant with our moral code &amp;ldquo;some of the time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple observation, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t hear about other people feeling this way anywhere else. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine why not, because if Lewis is right, we all feel the same way.  Maybe the non-religious point of view in fashion in the world today is that if you fail to live up to morals, then you&amp;rsquo;ve just plain failed, so we all give it up.  There&amp;rsquo;s no real acknowledgment in the society I live in that this failure is to be taken for granted, and that you then have to decide how to proceed. This theme is central to &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, and I think it deserves a lot of thought, but I still suspect you can separate it from the religious aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s not too surprising that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been exposed to this train of thought, because I read mainly fiction, and watch movies and some television.  I don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of nonfiction reading, outside of these Lewis books.  Maybe I should broaden that horizon a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final point.  I&amp;rsquo;m playing both sides of the fence in these entries about Lewis.  I&amp;rsquo;m very accepting of his ideas, and clearly I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find deep truths here.  But at the same time, I reserve the right not to be thought of as religious!  I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought the details through, but I believe I can accept these truths without linking them with God, and especially not with Jesus. I think these are psychological ideas, and many of the concepts of morality are societal ones. My firm belief is that all of this can be looked at with or without God, but that the decision as to which is very important. But it is still a decision. It may not be arbitrary for every person, i.e. for some people maybe only one side makes sense. But I believe in this &amp;ldquo;freedom to choose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Civil War</title>
      <link>/2004/07/the-civil-war/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2004 16:07:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2004/07/the-civil-war/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been renting Ken Burns&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Civil War&lt;/em&gt; shows lately, from Netflix. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a misconception I learned I had about the Civil War. My memory from school left me thinking that the war would involve a large set of complicated virtuosic battlefield maneuvers, and that I&amp;rsquo;d come to appreciate how all the famous generals were geniuses. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d somehow developed the opinion that the generals during that war outshine generals in other wars, that through a coincidence of history, the best strategists somehow simultaneously appeared during that conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve written that idea down, you can see how ill-informed it must be. The way Ken Burns presents most of the battles, there are indeed arrows and colored bars moving over maps, but the level of intelligence rarely rises above common sense. In fact, it seems that common sense alone makes you a great general. There were many instances of really stupid attacks. A pattern that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen repeated (Picket&amp;rsquo;s Charge, Cold Harbor, etc.) is where a really entrenched group on a hill and/or behind a wall is charged by the enemy (the North, usually) and the troops that are dug in just mow down the attackers, for hours and hours, killing thousands of men. It seemed that all that was needed to be a great general was to avoid that kind of decision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Does Tolkien think Good always defeats Evil?</title>
      <link>/2004/06/does-tolkien-think-good-always-defeats-evil/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2004 02:54:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2004/06/does-tolkien-think-good-always-defeats-evil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought Tolkien was essentially pessimistic, despite the happy ending of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;. The power of Evil he describes, and the inevibatle comparisons to the horror of World War I make this a convincing point of view. The army of Gondor is forced to risk a suicidal attack against a formidable foe to even preserve their tiny ghost of a chance of victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than this, the mood of the work is very bleak. The larger story arc about the Elves that includes &lt;em&gt;The Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; is in Elrond&amp;rsquo;s words a story about &amp;ldquo;fighting the long defeat.&amp;rdquo; The defeat of Sauron, a minor lieutenant of the world&amp;rsquo;s great evil, Melkor, means the end of the Elves&amp;rsquo; rings of power and their final flight into the West, having finally failed to &amp;ldquo;make a go of it&amp;rdquo; in Middle Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Frodo&amp;rsquo;s victory is bittersweet. His path to redemption was to press on through despair and hopelessness, and in the process receive deep spiritual wounds that would never heal. In the end, he has to forsake the Shire and leave Middle Earth as well. This is not really a happy ending, in the sense of Good people living happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really say I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind, but reflecting on the book recently reminded me that there are definitely a few moments where Tolkien is saying something else, and I wanted to share them. These are small quotes from the books (in fact, all three are from &lt;em&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; and didn&amp;rsquo;t make it into the movie). I&amp;rsquo;ll present the context and the quotes, then indicate why I thought they are optimistic (though I think they&amp;rsquo;re quite crystal clear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When referring to chapters of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s customary to use notation like VI.1, meaning Book 6, Chapter 1. Recall that each of the three novels is divided into two Books each, for a total of 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter V.2, the orcs are attacking Minas Tirith. The orcs bring Grond, the giant battering ram, and bash the main gate open. The chief of the Nazgul, the Witch King of Angmar, rides through the gate to take the first level of the city, but finds Gandalf on Shadowfax, who challenges him. This is a bleak moment for Gondor, when the military might of Sauron has utterly defeated the city. The Nazgul replies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away beyond in some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin&amp;rsquo;s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter VI.1 Frodo has been taken prisoner by the orcs after they find him wrapped in Shelob&amp;rsquo;s web. The orcs defeated, Sam and Frodo are discussing how to get some food, and Sam wonders out loud whether orcs eat poison rather than real food. Frodo replies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next chapter, VI.2, when Sam and Frodo are hunkering down for the night, Sam looks up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and third quote are quite similar. In both, events outside the context of the story&amp;rsquo;s characters remind the reader (and the characters) that all their important doings are taking place in a larger world, one where the battle against Sauron is a small matter. It is a small matter because that outside world is essentially Good. In both cases, it is a form of natural beauty that calls attention to itself, and I think Tolkien is using this beauty to indicate the Goodness of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle quote, Frodo&amp;rsquo;s remark about how Sauron can mock but not make, is drawing a distinction between God and Satan, I think. Tolkien believes there is an inherent power in Good that cannot be duplicated by Evil. This is a tenet of faith, a religious point of view, that makes Sauron&amp;rsquo;s defeat more of an inevitability. Note that I can&amp;rsquo;t reconcile this idea with the fact that Sauron forges a powerful ring, an act of creation that holds real meaning because it can only be undone with great difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Two of the above scenes (the first and third) now appear in the Extended Edition release of the movie version of &lt;em&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;. The movie version of the first scene is missing the element I&amp;rsquo;m highlighting here, namely the crowing of the cock. Also, this same scene has the Witch King breaking Gandalf&amp;rsquo;s staff, which is inferior to the more mental struggle I think is portrayed in the text. The movie version of the third moment, where Sam sees the star in the sky, is changed only in that Sam points the star out to Frodo and shares his thoughts. I was very glad this was inserted in the Extended Edition, and there is even a companion moment where Frodo and Sam see an old king&amp;rsquo;s statue briefly lit by the sun with a wreath of flowers for a crown &amp;ndash; a similar image of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New feature: better links</title>
      <link>/2004/04/new-feature-better-links/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2004 21:46:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2004/04/new-feature-better-links/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new feature on Long Head is the new super-accurate &amp;ldquo;Greg Links&amp;rdquo; list on the left. Except for the other langmead.info sites, these links are the sites I&amp;rsquo;m actually actively reading every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep up to date with almost all my favorite internet sites by subscribing to RSS feeds using the free service at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bloglines.com&#34;&gt;BlogLines&lt;/a&gt;. RSS feeds are little XML files published by sites alongside the web pages with the actual content. As an example, here is a link to one of the many &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/world/europe/rss091.xml&#34;&gt;RSS feeds published by the BBC&lt;/a&gt; (covering, in this case, just their European news).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When RSS was invented, the feeds were meant to allow easy syndication into those little customizable boxes on portal pages like Netscape and Yahoo. But these days it&amp;rsquo;s also common to use them in aggregators like BlogLines, where they become similar to mailboxes, with changes to the xml file coming in like new emails. Of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t read the XML itself, rather the XML contains information like a headline, a link to the full story, and a brief summary. The headlines and summaries let you skip over everything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest you, and in that way it&amp;rsquo;s become my main tool for coping with information overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly, RSS feeds and aggregators are the &amp;ldquo;other half&amp;rdquo; of the blog system itself: every blog engine (Blogger.com, Movable Type, Radio, etc.) publishes an RSS feed file that is kept in sync with the blog. Blogs then become just like news sites: new postings are gathered by aggregators and people can keep up with them that way. At the bottom of my left navbar you&amp;rsquo;ll see an image with a link to Long Head&amp;rsquo;s RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Greg Links. BlogLines supports a scheme where I put a little snippet of code in the Long Head home page to generate a list of exactly the sites whose feeds I currently subscribe to. When I add a new feed or stop subscribing to one, Long Head reflects those changes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish the links on Long Head to serve the same purpose as the rest of this site &amp;ndash; as a diary of my thoughts and activities. If you want to know just about every single piece of informational input that goes into my head, then listen to NPR and read those web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book review: C. S. Lewis</title>
      <link>/2004/04/book-review-c.-s.-lewis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2004 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2004/04/book-review-c.-s.-lewis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This winter I read three books by C. S. Lewis: &lt;em&gt;The Great Divorce&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Screwtape Letters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Surprised by Joy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been introduced to Lewis before, when I was young. I read the first several books of the &lt;em&gt;Narnia&lt;/em&gt; series, and I read the whole &lt;em&gt;Out of the Silent Planet&lt;/em&gt; trilogy. Back then, however, I was looking for pure entertainment from those books, and although they delivered it, the religious level was also apparent, and detracted from their enjoyment for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back to Lewis through Tolkien, having read &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; several times now and wondering a bit about how much religion to look for in it. Lewis and Tolkien were friends and colleagues, and I knew Lewis wrote religious works, so I was hoping to gain insight into Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s religious side this way.  So, this time around I was looking for the religious content, and curious about how Lewis approached it.  I chose works that I was told were good examples of his religious writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that he emphasizes all the aspects of Christianity that I find most comforting.  In fact, one of Lewis&amp;rsquo; central ideas in &lt;em&gt;The Great Divorce&lt;/em&gt; suggests the sort of therapy we could all use. In this allegorical story, the visitors to Heaven must let go of things that make life on earth more like Hell: an attachment to unhappiness and to fear.  To hold onto these things, and use them for nourishment instead of their opposites, leads not to safety and peace (since to my mind they are intended as protection against hurt) but to a bland and bleak life, empty and devoid of beauty.  To make this trade-off is not only foolish, it is Lewis&amp;rsquo; definition of Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting go of fear and anger, however, seems to me to be an issue on a psychological level, not a religious one.  And I kept feeling this disconnect throughout all three books, as well as during a recent re-reading of &lt;em&gt;Out of the Silent Planet&lt;/em&gt;.  The real lessons kept seeming very earthly to me, suggesting attitude adjustments that could take place in the here and now, under one&amp;rsquo;s own power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost like a self-help book, Lewis seemed to be instructing us about joy, something I think everyone already has a fully fleshed-out idea of, if only by contradiction to their own disappointments in life.  He never draws a very convincing connection between this freedom from fear and God or Jesus.  At one point in &lt;em&gt;Surprised by Joy&lt;/em&gt;, which chronicles his own conversion in adulthood, Lewis, having tapped into a realization of God&amp;rsquo;s existence, and having learned how to let go and stop grasping at false images of happiness, he then began to &amp;ldquo;shop around&amp;rdquo; for a religion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few sentences later, after having rejected Hinduism as &amp;ldquo;coexistence of philosophy side by side with Paganism unpurged&amp;rdquo; he says of Christianity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis is a renowned Christian writer, and I am not dismissing his ability to explain or shore up the ideas of Christianity. The point I&amp;rsquo;m making is that when I read these three books, I did not find a very strong explanation of why Christianity and faith must play a role in setting the moral and psychological tone of one&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did not find evidence either way as to whether &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; is a Christian work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did find, however, was an excellent and inspiring account of the &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; that one must make to be happy. In a way, happiness &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the choice to be happy, and Lewis provides very insightful and persuasive images of what it means to make that choice, and why it is so easy to decide the opposite instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to moving on to other projects, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m happy it&amp;rsquo;s finished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m blogging this from a Starbucks in Hollywood, near the big shopping center called Hollywood &amp;amp; Highland. Alison is out with a friend nearby, so I decided to try out the Starbucks hotspot system. Works pretty well, but only for 24 hours &amp;ndash; next time I visit a Starbucks I&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay $6 for an hour, then 10 cents a minute afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Update on Mac rant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll finish my &lt;a href=&#34;/archives/000090.html&#34;&gt;rant against the Mac&lt;/a&gt;. I think that primarily I was angry about the state of affairs typically faced by a developer. However, despite the fact that I do think documentation of the Carbon toolkit is flawed, and I have some fundamental problems with the way these legacy facilities have been brought into OS X, for the most part I find I&amp;rsquo;m still very excited about the Mac, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a very positive experience with the much more modern Cocoa environment. So, all in all, I think the game situation is pathetic, but the Mac still has many compelling advantages. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try to sort this out in a later posting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding my thoughts soon about three books by C. S. Lewis that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished. Although I had a few false starts with the Narnia books as a youth, these were read more to find out about the real Christian thinker, and because I wanted to branch out from Tolkien to some of his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I decided to put some thought into why I have so much trouble getting good at real-time strategy computer games. I went ahead and submitted it to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com&#34;&gt;GameSpot&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite gaming news site, which does a weekly set of op-ed pieces with a slot for a reader to opine. Well, my article was accepted! &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com/features/6084762/index.html&#34;&gt;Have a read&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m the second one down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made two changes to my video game family. First, I bought a GameCube and a couple games (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/adventure/legendofzeldathewindwaker/review.html&#34;&gt;Zelda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/viewtifuljoe/review.html&#34;&gt;Viewtiful Joe&lt;/a&gt;). Also, a friend with a vinyl cutter made a wood-grain applique for my Xbox. &lt;a href=&#34;/images/GregsTrueLoves.html&#34;&gt;Click to see the new family!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac Diatribe: Lack of Games</title>
      <link>/2003/09/mac-diatribe-lack-of-games/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2003 01:35:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2003/09/mac-diatribe-lack-of-games/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a serious gamer, just below the rank of what the press call &amp;ldquo;hardcore.&amp;rdquo; I own an XBox, a GameBoy, and a very fast PC. By way of Mac hardware, I own an aging 1999 Powerbook, and I have no plans to buy another Mac. In fact, any serious gamer must automatically reject the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games played on computers remain of a different character than those you find on consoles, and include genres that will never be appropriate on a console, especially real-time strategy games (Warcraft, Rise of Nations, etc.). If you want to play real-time strategy games, you need Windows, though, because the best games are not available on the Mac. Apple would have you believe that the cream of the crop gets ported to Mac, and this is true for Warcraft, but in general it&amp;rsquo;s an unfair overstatement. Rise of Nations is a superb game, and its absence from the Mac pretty much makes the Mac a non-viable gaming platform. There are many more examples of top-flight games that never get ported than do. Half-Life and Grim Fandango, where were those? And most of the smaller games that flesh out the offerings on PC have no hope of being ported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to port games six months later, either, because the marketing reality is that games, like movies, are partially about hype and a buildup in the press. Mainstream gaming sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespy.com&#34;&gt;Gamespy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com&#34;&gt;Gamespot&lt;/a&gt; cover PC games as they&amp;rsquo;re released for Windows. If the Mac is not supported on release day, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, except for people who have to wait anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a truism in the PC world that great new games drive hardware sales. That means that the Windows platform has a beneficial symbiotic relationship with games that the Mac is missing out on. This holds the Mac market back, and throttles enthusiasm for new hardware. Instead, Apple tries to dole out upgrade enthusiasm by releasing cool new products. This can never work, because of the inherent interest Apple has in selling hardware. People need their own independent reasons for wanting new hardware, other than the release of the hardware itself. Marketing can&amp;rsquo;t work in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated Mac-heads will read the above and immediately point out that there is a frustrating catch-22 in the lack of a games market: companies won&amp;rsquo;t invest the resources in porting games unless the Mac market is big. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;m saying the Mac market is going to remain small unless there are more games. This is true, but Apple isn&amp;rsquo;t doing anything about it and they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also a game studio, and makes high-quality games for PC and the XBox. They did this buy buying existing game studios and fuelling them with cash and resources. Apple should consider doing the same thing, but with porting houses. Maybe they can even convince studios to write games cross-platform from the beginning, the way Blizzard does. If they can help with some tools that make it easy to make these conversions, that would go a long way towards subsidizing a larger games market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I&amp;rsquo;m not knocking the legacy of excellent Mac-only or Mac-first games. Ambrosia and LittleWing spring to mind because I have enjoyed their games over the years. Shareware games are not really under discussion here because they don&amp;rsquo;t have a major impact on the platform&amp;rsquo;s market share the way million-copy-selling games do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please understand I&amp;rsquo;m of two minds about the Mac, and so my remarks should be taken like those of a concerned parent, rather than, say, a Palestinian suicide bomber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main points are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inadequate developer documentation, including horrifying backward steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of affordable hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterproductive &amp;ldquo;boutique&amp;rdquo; model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignorance of the real competitive advantages over Linux, Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poorly managed transition to OS X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Diatribe against Macs coming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a pretty major piece of Mac software for almost two and a half years. As I&amp;rsquo;ve gone along, I&amp;rsquo;ve run up against the shortcomings not only of the developer resources, but of course also in OS X itself, since developers are also users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m essentially ready to abandon the Mac for greener pastures elsewhere, but I have to work it out a bit first, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to be posting a multi-section reflection on the matter. I am extremely hesitant to change my attitude from &amp;ldquo;mac-zealot&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;mac-doubter,&amp;rdquo; and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the issues going on here. The Mac demands defensiveness from its adherents, and so I meet much resistance from my own history and contrary nature when I consider embracing my disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much more coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got wireless today! It&amp;rsquo;s totally new to me, but not to most other people, so I won&amp;rsquo;t dwell on it. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m in bed, which means Penelope is in the chair and Alison&amp;rsquo;s got her arms all over my pillows. This laptop has a very loud hard drive, which I already knew, but which is a bit more of a problem in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished watching &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt; and it reminds me of an issue I have with the grammar of the Aerosmith/Dianne Warren song &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Want to Miss a Thing.&amp;rdquo; The lyrics go &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t want to fall asleep / &amp;lsquo;cause I miss you babe / and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss a thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t help but hear this the wrong way &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s my contrary nature. My interpretation is that he&amp;rsquo;s singing &amp;ldquo;I miss you. You&amp;rsquo;re an object. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss an object, so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss you.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s analogous to saying &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;cause I miss you babe / and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss a blockhead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I know he isn&amp;rsquo;t saying anything of the kind, but the proximity of two uses of &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; makes this an automatic alternative my brain entertains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was my 30th birthday. Alison threw me a surprise party (just the two of us) on Friday night and made me a bunny cake! Yesterday she gave me a bottle of &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice tequila, and I had some with breakfast ;-). My brother got me a book, and there are more gifts on the way that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they are. Alison and I had a nice visit to our favorite boba tea place in Long Beach, then headed over to Anaheim to see the Angels play the Mariners, and I got a proper Angels hat. It&amp;rsquo;s made of really light, breathable material and it was very comfortable. It also represents some sort of turning point for me, as I do not change baseball allegience lightly, though eventually I guess I always do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alison&#39;s PhD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week, my wife&amp;rsquo;s dissertation was aproved by Columbia&amp;rsquo;s dissertation office, meaning the printouts had the right margins, her paperwork made its way from the Art History department, her library fees were all paid, her account was in good standing, and 12 years of your typical bureaucratic wrangling has sorted itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of Alison for seeing this project through. It was a long project, beginning back in 1997 when we took our first trip to Cahors in southern France and she got the idea of doing a massive geographic survey of Romanesque architecture. But it&amp;rsquo;s not just the length, it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that she did it on her own (with a little technical and minor logistical help from me, but my whining cancels that out), often against hardship imposed by lesser or more jaded minds. If anyone had thought that academics was about the pursuit of knowledge and study, to understand our place in history and in the universe, they would be pretty much wrong. Academics is dominated by small minds and people who try to stop the proliferation of great ideas, just like in other pursuits. There really is no good home for people who want to pursue true, pure knowledge and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I actually had time to play some Gameboy games today! I have quite a backlog, which will surprise no one who knows me, and it felt good to give it some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father-in-law got me &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com/gba/strategy/advancewars/index.html&#34;&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/a&gt; for Christmas, and I love it! I was afraid it would be confusing, but the designers have succeeded in making it very accessible. Any game that hides complexity with an accessible and fun interface, and especially good tutorials, becomes addictive &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a rule somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also picked up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/legendofzeldaalinkttp/index.html&#34;&gt;Zelda: A Link to the Past&lt;/a&gt; again. I was somewhere in the middle, and when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t immediately remember what had already happened, I decided to start over. (Aside: people like me who like big games, yet have little time to devote to them often end up in the position of having to start all over to keep continuity. It adds that extra level of frustration to the sense of lost time.) Well, it turned out I was only about three minutes from the beginning! So that was a relief. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s also a great game with very interesting maps and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I hope to get Pokemon Advance, and to get back into Golden Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

First there was a Movable Type blog in 2001, then a radio blog, then a new radio blog, and then this new Movable Type blog. I&amp;rsquo;m going to settle on this one, but all my old posts to the other blogs will just have to be lost unless I can muster the enthusiasm for scrounging them up somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just about finished re-listening to my audio-book version of &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt;, which I enjoyed immensely. I&amp;rsquo;ve now read the dead-tree book once, and listened to this audio book twice.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s about physics, quantum computation, DNA, and lots of other topics, sort of unified into a really interesting and idiosyncratic world-view. David Deutsch is a father of quantum computing, so he knows what he&amp;rsquo;s talking about. I always prefer well-expressed personal viewpoints to bland, objective information.&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoyed it, but it was a little slow. Basically it explores the idea (in fictional form) that gods from the various pantheons traveled to America with the settlers and started trying to eke their living here. In this day and age, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to be a god, and they&amp;rsquo;re almost like pathetic people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2002/08/so-langmead.info-seems-relatively-stable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So langmead.info seems relatively stable at the moment. As of now I have tried three hosting companies. This latest one strikes a good balance between price and features. They are having trouble installing PHPlib, which is needed for IMP, which is a web-based email client Alison wants. I might consider moving if they never get around to that (or upgrading to PHP 4.1, which would be just as good).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that we have a home for family pictures, personal web sites (like this blog) and email. Mostly the last, because with mac.com going fee-based, and with the years passing and the number of email addresses I&amp;rsquo;ve used growing, it seems like a good time to have a &lt;em&gt;permanent&lt;/em&gt; email address, and paying for the domain and the hosting puts it under my control, so it can remain as permanent as &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have progressed nicely in my quest to hear new music that I like. I bought two CDs! Blur&amp;rsquo;s greatest hits (or is it &amp;ldquo;best of?&amp;quot;) and Ben Folds Five (Whatever and ever amen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed both, especially the Blur. I will be trying some more of their stuff very soon. I&amp;rsquo;m a little frustrated that they didn&amp;rsquo;t get along with Andy Partridge when he was lined up as producer, but then again Andy is supposedly not very easy to get along with, at least when it comes to music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/2002/03/i-need-new-music.-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2002 02:09:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2002/03/i-need-new-music.-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I need new music. For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a core group of bands: XTC, Beatles, Squeeze, Joe Jackson, various solo Beatles, R.E.M., Billy Joel and They Might Be Giants, with smaller amounts of the B-52&amp;rsquo;s, Indigo Girls, and a little Classical (mostly Mozart, Bach and Beethoven of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to change a little bit.  I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped my toes into new music and I have been really well rewarded. Radiohead, Jude, and David Yazbek are the biggest successes. Alanis Morisette not so much, really. I just started another push into the water with Badly Drawn Boy, Owsley, and Apples in Stereo.  Those didn&amp;rsquo;t impress me much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to strike out in a completely new direction, into some genre that I&amp;rsquo;m completely ignorant of. The best thing about Radiohead, Jude and Yazbek is the originality, or rather the difference from my usual fare, whichever. But this is exactly what makes finding new music hard: if I know the kind of music, and not the bands, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I&amp;rsquo;m at it, I need a fresh look at Classical music. New symphonies by composers I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with, or whole new composers and subgenres. For example, I really like the Mahler I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, but I only have a couple of his symphonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to buy too many CDs, I need to be pretty clever about it. This is exactly the purpose to which Napster et al are &lt;em&gt;poorly suited&lt;/em&gt;, because you have to &lt;em&gt;type something in&lt;/em&gt;, not browse. That&amp;rsquo;s the stereotypically male shopping model, and at this point I need more of the female model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution I&amp;rsquo;ve had some success with is searching the archives of fan bulletin boards of bands I know I like. If you search for &amp;ldquo;recommend,&amp;rdquo; then you can read postings where the fans suggest music to each other, which makes a lot of sense if you like the band the list is based on. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at more lists besides &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chalkhills.org&#34;&gt;XTC&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently rented &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; in audiobook format, on CD, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.recordedbooks.com&#34;&gt;Recorded Books&lt;/a&gt;. They make, sell, and rent audiobooks. When you rent, they send you the books in a box-within-a-box. The inner box is for sending it back, so there is very little hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t tell them, but I am ripping the whole set into MP3 format, so that I can listen on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ipod&#34;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;. I am not doing it to steal the books, or put them up on Limewire, I just want to put the data in my own bucket, as it were. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; relaxing to kick back and listen to a book, so I recommend poring over the selection at Recorded Books.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So the Paint-by-Numbers project, named</title>

      <guid>/2002/03/so-the-paint-by-numbers-project-named/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the Paint-by-Numbers project, named Go-Gan, is proceeding. Absolutely no interface has been coded yet, just the representation of the underlying puzzle. Tonight I&amp;rsquo;ll write the logic that creates the list of clues from a row or column of painted cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that&amp;rsquo;s done, I&amp;rsquo;m going to skip over the hardest part of all, and go to the user interface and Cocoa bits. The hard part is a feature where a player working on a puzzle can get a hint.  No matter what hinting system I eventually implement, they all rely on the computer being able to (secretly) solve a puzzle completely. Certain scenarios may not require the whole puzzle to be solved in order to give the hint, but the real underlying purpose of this project, besides learning Cocoa, is to figure out how to get a computer to solve a PBN from just the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know are the ad-hoc rules that Alison and I apply to a PBN puzzle, but sometimes there are several speculative steps needed, which will require the computer to perhaps build a branching tree of decisions, in order to arrive at a contradiction in all but one path from root to leaves.  The most important principle, though, is the &amp;ldquo;more than half&amp;rdquo;, where a clue tells you there are &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; cells colored black in a space where fewer than &lt;em&gt;2n&lt;/em&gt; will fit. This allows you to fill in some of the middle squares, which then give you information about the columns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2002/03/im-going-to-get-started/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get started today on a new piece of software. It will be a multipurpose &amp;ldquo;Paint by Numbers&amp;rdquo; application. Paint by Numbers is a puzzle game (I am not yet sure whether this name is a trademark or not) where you are presented with a blank rectangular grid of squares, usually about 20x20 or larger (the bigger it is, the harder it is). The goal is to reproduce the picture by deducing which squares should be colored. The clues are lists of numbers, one list for each row and one list for each column. Each number in the list is the tally for a consecutive run of colored squares. Visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www02.so-net.ne.jp/~kajitani/cgi-bin/pbn.cgi/index.html&#34;&gt;this Japanese site&lt;/a&gt; for some examples to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to write the app in Cocoa, the native environment for Mac OS X. In fact, this is just my excuse to learn Cocoa. When Apple computer bought Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; company Next in 1995 (?), they did so to obtain the sophisticated Nextstep operating system. This became Mac OS X, and the then-revolutionary Nextstep programming framework became Cocoa. Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser, wrote all of it using Nextstep. Why? Because it was easy, supposedly. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored it a little bit and I find it very exciting. It is easy in the sense that many things come for free, as in Java, but it is also hard in that it leaves me running to the documentation all the time &amp;ndash; once I commit the core of Cocoa to memory, this will disappear as well and it probably &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; seem easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write the engine in C++, though, not Objective-C (the language you have to use to use Cocoa). The engine will include the abstraction of what a Paint-by-Numbers puzzle is, and the things the player can do to it. Actually wiring that up to a user of the app will be another layer, the user interface layer. This layer will listen to mouse clicks and whatnot, and will then call the appropriate message in the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the most common way to interact with the puzzle will be to click on a square cell. When the click is heard, I will have to compute which square on the screen it was in, and therefore which abstract cell it is. Then, I will ask the abstract &amp;ldquo;paint by numbers cell object,&amp;rdquo; which is invisible to the user, to alter its state (turn it black, for example). Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll have the representation of the cell on the screen update accordingly, by asking the abstract cell what color it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working out the architecture, but I should have some progress by day&amp;rsquo;s end.  I have some &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com&#34;&gt;Economist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; magazine reading to do too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; the other day. I was pretty young, so take this with a grain of salt, but here&amp;rsquo;s what I was thinking. At the beginning, a mood of chaos is set when as-yet-unintroduced high-ranking officials meet in a remote location where a World War II plane (boat?) has been found.  They arrive in a helicopter, and part of the fun and tension of the scene is the landing of this loud helicopter. It really is exciting, because, you know, you don&amp;rsquo;t see helicopters land every day.  These guys must really be important, and there must be quite a bit of urgency!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, having helicopters land in movies is totally cliche. I will never again feel like it is significant for characters to use helicopters, so the device is useless.  I just say to myself, &amp;ldquo;Okay, here these guys are. They&amp;rsquo;re army dudes, there are three of them&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; whatever.  This is a very general problem with imitation, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m against imitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s crucial for there to be certain kinds of imitation in certain cases, but &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would like to strive not to use it. I would rather be the innovator who creates &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters&lt;/em&gt; than the joker who just creates knock-offs.  Plus, the really significant experiences of my life were never repeats, they were new! It is hard and elusive to communicate something in a truly new way, but very worthwile and satisfying to both parties. So, please, could we all try to innovate a little more?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of buzz about a book called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gonzomarkets.com/cluetrain&#34;&gt;The Cluetrain Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell if it&amp;rsquo;s about dotcoms, or about social forces in the Internet Age. But, they provided the whole book online, so I ciphoned it onto my Palm and I&amp;rsquo;m going to read it. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alison came up with an interesting quote in her dissertation research on 12th century France:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I hear more and more about this time period from Alison, I see why she studies history. It sheds light forward onto our own time. Would you describe our current ways of thinking as &amp;ldquo;eschewing univocal interpretations,&amp;rdquo; because I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. I forget who said the following but I agree and I guess so would the scholars of 1100: the older I get, the more I learn that not only is it okay to hold contradictory beliefs, but the deepest, most important elements of life are bound up in such opposing truths.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting to understand the news aggregator concept. It is the flipside of the blog. It addresses my earliest question about blogs: won&amp;rsquo;t everything I write just disappear into the void?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-geeks reading this, a news aggregator is a single program or web page that gathers together a generalized version of &amp;ldquo;headlines.&amp;rdquo; These can certainly include headlines, like from the BBC or AP wire. But they can also include postings or articles from any site that is &amp;ldquo;syndicated,&amp;rdquo; in a certain technical way, like this one is. You could ask your aggregator to pull in content from this very site, each time I update it. See how it provides the &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt; with the corresponding tool to the &lt;em&gt;author&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; tool of the blog?  By the way, this very product, Radio, includes a news aggregator and so marries the two tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics tonight, but over the last few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been growing increasingly uneasy about what I might see there. As it turned out, after the initial voice-overs by Messrs. McKay (co-alum of my high school!) and Costas, I turned off the television. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to tune in when events I want to see are on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is nationalism, and the two forms it has taken since September 11th. First, is the lower-brow flag waving habit. There was actually a fight over allowing the flag from the top of the WTC to make an appearance during the ceremonies. Give me a break! If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that important before 9/11, then it is exactly that important today, no more and no less. All people really mean when they wave these things around is &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m part of something bigger than I am and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to assert my identity for a few minutes! Hooray!&amp;rdquo; My good friend Carl Sagan has a pretty good understanding of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here: the pre-human part of our brain controls this emotion. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s reptilian. Don&amp;rsquo;t follow leaders or symbols blindly, you&amp;rsquo;re better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second and much worse problem is what Bob Costas said (paraphrasing): &amp;ldquo;America was thrust unexpectedly into the middle of history.&amp;rdquo; There is real feeling that this is an emotional time, and that to ham it up and make it one of the overtones of the Olympics is only natural. Bullshit! Events like what happened in NYC and in DC on the 11th happen ALL THE TIME, ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND HAVE DONE SO FOR MILLENIA. The fact is, we&amp;rsquo;re just not used to it, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t elevate it over the concerns of other nations. There have been earthquakes in the last two years that have killed more people than those planes did, ten times over. There have been devastating wars and strife for all of history. To take this one event and treat it with so much melodrama just drives home to me that we, as a nation, do not care about anyone other than ourselves. It kind of makes you begin to understand the feelings of anger that pervade the third world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My e-book obsession</title>
      <link>/2001/11/my-e-book-obsession/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2001 01:29:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2001/11/my-e-book-obsession/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I HAVE AN E-BOOK OBSESSION! Did you know that? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-book is obviously short for electronic book. This sounds like a nineteenth century name for what it is: a computer file. In such a computer file are the contents of a book. For example, a Word document with Pride and Prejudice in it is an e-book. So is a plain text file of the same book, or a web page or any other format. The point is that the environment where the book is read is a digital computer environment. There are a few issues about e-books that I think are important. First, there is the issue of reading an entire book on a screen. Despite that, I am obsessed with reading e-books, so I will explain why. Finally, what does the future hold for e-books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detractors say that e-books are not going to be widely read until they appear on screens that are much fancier than our low-resolution devices of today. A typical computer monitor has fewer than 100 pixels per inch of screen, so the most precise unit of measurement is 1/100 inch. Book printing is done at a much higher resolution, and so the character shapes (&amp;lsquo;glyphs&amp;rsquo; in technical jargon) are very detailed lovely curves, compared to the collections of dots that you get on a screen. It is generally thought that it is easier to read the high-resolution text than the low. Moreover, monitors and laptop displays are backlit, where a book uses reflected light. Monitors blink at around 60-100 times per second, which can give you a headache (though laptop displays do not blink at all, which makes them more comfortable). All this adds up to a reading experience that tires your eyes pretty quickly. In the future, we may have &amp;ldquo;digital ink,&amp;rdquo; which is an umbrella term for a number of emerging technologies that work much more like a book. These would have a sheet of material that would feel like paper or plastic, but would be digital in that each page would have electrical current and a grid of extremely tiny pixels, such that the resolution was maybe as high as 1200 pixels per inch. Some sort of computer chip, maybe embedded right in the page, would turn pixels on and off and set them to different colors, to produce a document as lovely as a printed page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so if reading electronic text is so awful, and can give you a headache, why do you read them? Well, my e-books don&amp;rsquo;t give me a headache. I read them on my Palm, and it neither blinks nor is backlit. The Palm screen works using reflected light just like page, or more to the point a digital watch. It has black LCD pixels on a light gray background, so it has high contrast and no flickering. When it&amp;rsquo;s dark, I do turn on the backlighting, and it indeed gives me a headache before too long. As for the pixellated fonts, they don&amp;rsquo;t bother me. I have a selection of fonts on my Palm and I have chosen ones that were very well designed to take advantage of the pixellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an art to making text readable at low resolution &amp;ndash; compare some of the fonts on your computer at small point sizes and see which ones you think had readability at small sizes as a design goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the problems I mentioned before don&amp;rsquo;t bother me. What&amp;rsquo;s so great, though? Why read an e-book instead of a paper book? E-books are one of those things that don&amp;rsquo;t make as much sense before you use them as they do after. Computers and the Internet required the same kind of transition, for example. But I can give you some of the reasons that reading books on my Palm lead to this je ne sais quoi. The main one is that the Palm holds several books. That means that without carrying anything extra around, I have several novels. (And the Palm itself is very slight and is always with me anyway, for notes and To Do&amp;rsquo;s and names and addresses and the like.) If I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in line at the bank, or on a bus, or waiting for Alison to find some pants at Old Navy, I can (and do) slip my Palm out of my pocket and resume reading right were I left off. I have one of the buttons on the front re-assigned to launching my e-book program, so that I can perform all of this with just my thumb. If you like reading, then the idea of bringing your books that much closer and having them that much more accessible will make sense to you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another plus is the ability to read with one hand. I can use my thumb to scroll to the next page if I hold my Palm upside-down and rotate the display as well (screen orientation is an option in my e-book reader). This works great at meals, and when straphanging on public transportation. You can search for text too, which I&amp;rsquo;ve used to remind myself of past actions in the story, or to re-read a passage where a character was first introduced (oh, he&amp;rsquo;s her uncle). Finally, the backlighting is a boon for married folks. The dim light doesn&amp;rsquo;t disturb your bedmate, and so it solves the &amp;ldquo;reading in bed problem&amp;rdquo; for me. Like I said, though, it gets hard on my eyes within about 20 minutes. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re sold on e-books, let me warn you off a little bit. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get them. If you want to see the best store there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s good but it&amp;rsquo;s no Amazon, then visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peanutpress.com&#34;&gt;Peanutpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. They are owned by Palm and they have a pretty large selection, six or seven of which I&amp;rsquo;ve bought and downloaded. I hope that the future brings great growth to this and other vendors. What&amp;rsquo;s to lose? They do a one-time translation from the electronic source of the printed book into an e-book, and they sell each copy for $6, without having to make any books. The economics are there, so it&amp;rsquo;s just the usual chicken-and-egg market size story: the market isn&amp;rsquo;t there until there are lots of customers, but customers aren&amp;rsquo;t drawn until there are lots of books. Peanutpress is forging the way by selling all these books into a tiny market. There are more e-publishing ventures than there were a couple of years ago, though. The publishing houses have set up some online e-book stores, but they seem mainly geared to books that don&amp;rsquo;t also get printed the old way. This give the impression that they are second-rate fare, not good enough to publish as &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; books. Still, this means they are giving a voice to authors that they can&amp;rsquo;t afford to publish any other way (presumably), and more voices is good (as long as they aren&amp;rsquo;t spewing crap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read a lot more than five or six e-books, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve read about 20 novels this way, and I&amp;rsquo;m reading one now with four more lined up. How did I do that? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting, really. First I buy the book at a bookstore. I put it on my shelf and I never open it. Then, I go online (using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limewire.com&#34;&gt;Limewire&lt;/a&gt; usually, which is a Gnutella client) and I type in the author&amp;rsquo;s name. Often a list of text files pops up, and sometimes even fancier formats like RTF (which has formatting and bold and italic fonts) or HTML. These are created by someone with a &amp;ldquo;book scanner,&amp;rdquo; which is a regular scanner plus a page feeder. They cut off the spine of a book and feed all the pages in. The software puts the images in the right order and does character recognition on it, and makes a text file. These are then distributed over the internet for folks to download. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly like the way music and movies are pirated online, and it violates all the same copyright laws. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad, though, because I buy the book and merely use this technique to &amp;ldquo;move it onto my Palm.&amp;rdquo; Am I bad for doing that? I can&amp;rsquo;t tell, but I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me wrap this up by indicating some of the ideas that I consider to be at the fringe of e-books. Some will tell you that dedicated e-book readers like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gemstar-ebook.com/&#34;&gt;Gemstar e-book&lt;/a&gt; are what e-books are about. These devices are crippled compared to a Palm or other handheld. They are too big, too expensive, and they control what content you can install. You cannot convert one of your own text files or web pages to an appropriate format and load it onto the Gemstar, like you can with a Palm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another non-e-book line of thinking are the Adobe E-book reader and the Microsoft Reader. These are programs for your laptop or desktop machine, and so they are lacking the two main requirements of e-books: portability and reflective screens. I can curl up on the sofa with a cup of coffee and my Palm. If I were a PocketPC user (like Palms only with a Microsoft operating system) I&amp;rsquo;d be very disappointed right now. You can get lots of books in the Microsoft Reader format, but only a subset of those can be used with the Pocket PC version of the Reader. I can&amp;rsquo;t understand why, unless it&amp;rsquo;s because they have hard-coded line breaks that don&amp;rsquo;t work on the smaller pocket-sized screen. But that&amp;rsquo;s not a good enough reason &amp;ndash; make the line breaking dynamic and get the books on the handhelds!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aging</title>
      <link>/1999/01/aging/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 1999 04:11:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/1999/01/aging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://greg.langmead.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/banner.gif&#34; alt=&#34;1998Banner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note, this was written before I had a blog. I recovered it from the Internet Archive. Back in graduate school I had a “musings” section of my site and those essays are in the same spirit as this blog so I’ve added them with retroactive datestamps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three constants in the universe, so I&amp;rsquo;m told, are the speed of light, death, and taxes. I can&amp;rsquo;t really do anything about the speed of light, and I feel quite powerless to affect taxes, as I live in a city that charges almost as much in income tax as the state it&amp;rsquo;s in (Hint: this state is the most populous on the east coast and charges a &lt;strong&gt;buttload&lt;/strong&gt; in both income and sales tax, and the city shares its name). So, that leaves death. Now there I can at least do some explaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an analytical mind (nooooooo!). I like to reason things out, and so as my tiny being tries to grasp the true nature of life and death, it grabs on to little morsels. This particular morsel I want to share is so tiny, so not helpful, that it&amp;rsquo;s almost a waste. But it seems to explain a lot to me anyway, so I&amp;rsquo;ll carry on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue at hand is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolved&lt;/strong&gt;: People tend to feel their life slipping past them faster and faster as they get older. Middle-aged folks may even feel decades slip by at a time. As our store of patience grows, so does our tendency to allow time to pass in large chunks. Our lives speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this paradox is the following logical deduction: If &lt;em&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;c/a &amp;gt; c/b&lt;/em&gt;. (Okay, okay, so long as &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; is positive.) The way to read that more relevantly is, &amp;ldquo;If you are younger than me (&lt;em&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/em&gt;) then &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; days seems longer to you than to me (&lt;em&gt;c/a &amp;gt; c/b&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo; So the fractions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;c/a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;c/b&lt;/em&gt; represent the fraction of our total lives so far that waiting for &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; days represents. For example, if you are four years old, then waiting for a toy for a week represents waiting around 0.5% of the total amount of time you have ever existed. If I am 40, then a week is only 0.05% of my total lifespan. Said another way, waiting 10 weeks feels the same to me as waiting a week does for you, the four-year-old. And plus I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for a video game and not a toy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the math is meant to confuse you into thinking I&amp;rsquo;m right. Certainly you can&amp;rsquo;t argue that the equations don&amp;rsquo;t lie. What was left unsaid is the basic hypothesis here: we measure the size of periods of time in relation to our own total experience of time. As we gain familiarity with time&amp;rsquo;s flow, that is, as we age, we can let more of it trickle by in one gulp without thinking too much about it. But I feel it&amp;rsquo;s more precise than that: our sense of how long a month or a year is is proportional to our age. That means that a one-day-old baby (awww) feels as much time go by in its second day of life as I will between now and when I&amp;rsquo;m 50. Wow. And to think mommy gets most of that day alone with baby in the hospital. I&amp;rsquo;m jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note, this was written before I had a blog. I recovered it from the Internet Archive. Back in graduate school I had a &amp;ldquo;musings&amp;rdquo; section of my site and those essays are in the same spirit as this blog so I&amp;rsquo;ve added them with retroactive datestamps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently saw the movie &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;, directed by James Cameron. It provoked thoughts of many kinds, and I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure why. Part of it had to do with the moviemaking itself, which I&amp;rsquo;ll get to last. But part of it had to do with the story, as it was told, and the problem of negativity in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many people will tell you, &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; can be broken down as follows: an hour and a quarter of plot to get you involved, followed by two hours of sinking. The first part was very enjoyable. Basically, if you remember &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;, then you get the idea. Upper-class girl (17 years old! practically statutory rape) meets lower-class boy during suicide attempt off back of ship, where lower-class members of society hang out. Desperate for personal attention and true human interaction, she falls madly in love with him. He draws a picture of her naked, they become the first to do it in the back of a car, then the ship sinks and he dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, during the actual sinking, our young couple no longer form the focus of the movie. Instead, we are shown, in a style of moviemaking deliberately intended to smack of realism and documentary, how 2200 people from different segments of society would react to a crisis of this magnitude, as they scramble to get aboard enough lifeboats to save 1100 of them (but which end up only filled with 700). As Cameron (who also wrote the screenplay) shows us personal failure after personal failure, I found myself clicking my tongue along with it saying &amp;ldquo;Christ, what an ass,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that guy did that,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Yep. That&amp;rsquo;s how people would react all right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron shows too many negative moments, and almost no positive ones. I believe that there was just as much generosity and heroism to be found during this hell as there was animal behavior. Yes, people probably did keep others out of their lifeboat with an oar. Yes, the crew probably did tend to buckle under the pressure, but is there evidence that one of them started shooting people? (Of course, then that crew member blows his own head off in a grisley scene meant purely to shock. Shame on James.) Were there only cowardly men like the one that snuck onto a boat, praying he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be noticed, or were there also men who would have gladly sacrificed their place for another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron did provide counterpoint to these regrettable acts. He shows tender moments of parting between loved ones. And more parting between loved ones. And more. But no acts of bravery, no acts of self-sacrifice, no true human spirit coming through. The conclusion: James Cameron thinks there are no such people, except the fictional ones like Jack Dawson (our hero) who reside in a special world carved out for those who love like only fictional characters can do. No less than Romeo himself (no coincidence that whats-his-name was also in the recent MTV-videoesque version of &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;) could give of himself to save the life of a loved one. Bullshit. Lots of that was going on, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we being shown those stories too? Not just the brave goodbyes, but the ones who stopped to help a panicked woman get on her boat, the ones that offered solace and hope when there really was none, the women that chose to stay with their loved ones instead of being rescued. (Incidentally, wasn&amp;rsquo;t that Irish woman (from Terminator 2) with her two kids both on a lifeboat and in her cabin when it finally sank?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was the movie made that way? Why is it so negative? I am not sure, but I bet it has to do with making as much money from the movie as possible. That was obviously their motivation for doing every single thing they did. James Cameron is famously obsessive as a moviemaker. But take a look at his movies: they are pure candy. No grand themes, no elevating stories, no lovable characters. Just two-dimensional everything. Grab-your-attention, edge-of-your-seet, nonstop action. But in the process, he manages to beat every last shred of humanity from the story. The only reason for showing tenderness or real compassion is to set us up for the big disappointment when whoever it was gets blown away, or drowns, or freezes to death with her frozen baby in her arms (especially inappropriate, I thought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem such a great idea to use base ideas such as these to make a movie. It tends to make us unhappy, and who needs that? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go see someone tell me that people suck, that we&amp;rsquo;re a bunch of bastards, to show me how he thinks I&amp;rsquo;d react when placed on a sinking ship. Cameron has lowered our expectations of ourselves, and yet the movie will sell very well. We are used to seeing ourselves lowered in this way: take a look at the local news, or take a look at the way we act towards strangers, or take a look at how no one seems to stop bringing up the Holocaust, or even worse, bringing up the fact that that&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to the number of Russians killed. &amp;ldquo;But if we forget about it, we&amp;rsquo;re doomed to repeat it one day,&amp;rdquo; they say. Exactly my point. Nice positive outlook on humanity, isn&amp;rsquo;t it. It&amp;rsquo;s not hip to be down on people, it&amp;rsquo;s the most negative possible activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my opinions on the moviemaking itself (from a technical standpoint), something really jumped out at me as I made my way home on the subway. As you may know, computer animation was extensively used in this movie. How else could there be complete fly-bys of a beautiful model of the Titanic, complete with actors moving about on deck? A flyover by a nonexistent camera over a ship that sunk 84 years ago with people that were never there walking around on it. This concept is so striking that there were, by my count, at least 10 of these scenes in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is clear: with the aid of computer technology, absolutely anything you could possibly imagine can be convincingly placed on film. Did you see Mouse Hunt? You actually felt like you were the mouse running around in the nooks and crannies of the house, something that would have been impossible with a real camera (or a real house, for that matter). Or Star Wars: Special Edition. George Lucas even says in an interview that things that were impossible in 1980 were doable now, even easy (I added the easy part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer animation is not easy, but it is straightforward. Interfaces for 3D software is constantly growing more sophisticated. And this same software (Infini-D, Strata Studio, Ray Dream Studio, 3D Studio Max, Lightwave, SoftImage, etc.) is getting cheaper. You can get your hands on powerful 3D software for doing simple animations for $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute. Say that again? You mean millions of people have access to software only mildly crippled compared to what they made &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; with? That&amp;rsquo;s right. And just think how much cheaper and better this software will be in a few years. It&amp;rsquo;s inevitable in the computer industry that price will drop while ease of use and power will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagined a software program so easy to use that in a matter of moments I could have a 3D animation of exactly the idea in my head. Or a dream I had. Or something I saw. I could wake up, say &amp;ldquo;What a nightmare,&amp;rdquo; and show my wife exactly what the dream was. I could immediately &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; the person I was talking to the geometric shape I was studying. I would no longer have to wave my arms saying &amp;ldquo;big purple blobby thing with whiskers sort of and spots around the outside with a lever coming out crosswise from the center.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m having a hard time explaining here is that we might one day have a vehicle for showing exactly what&amp;rsquo;s in our minds, in 3 dimensions (4, including the potential for animation), instantly. What will this do to moviemaking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether I end up being able to show everyone my purple monster, sooner or later the folks that make movies will get fed up using their new power to just make things that look real. Enough dinosaurs, Godzillas, apes, mice, Titanics, explosions, space ships, and shields that come out of nowhere to encase a hero in metal. They&amp;rsquo;ll get more abstract. More creative. They&amp;rsquo;ll be able to express more subtle ideas than mere realism. They&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use the new medium like artists have been doing for millenia: they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to speak directly to our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hope it happens after James Cameron retires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note, this was written before I had a blog. I recovered it from the Internet Archive. Back in graduate school I had a “musings” section of my site and those essays are in the same spirit as this blog so I’ve added them with retroactive datestamps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really feel that our society cannot sustain the &amp;ldquo;computer geek&amp;rdquo; model for very much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ll now have to describe what I mean by that model. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, but probably never given much thought to. It&amp;rsquo;s bound to be the case that there are people who are more expert at any given job than others, and not long ago computers were hard for anyone to use, even experts. Therefore it&amp;rsquo;s not surprise that there are adults (but mainly kids) out there who are better than most at using computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I feel this edge will soften really soon, and perhaps disappear entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think some examples are in order. I work in a math department, and for years mathematicians have been into their email. That&amp;rsquo;s simply because mathematics is so specialized that the likelihood that all your favorite colleagues in your area teach at your school is nil. So, you need fast, cheap channells of communication open all the time, and email fits the bill ideally. At around the same time email was getting hot in math, so was TeX. TeX is a document typesetting system which allows us math folks to typeset our own papers and equations with completely professional appearance. It requires a fair bit of computing power, and it&amp;rsquo;s so esoteric that at first it was only to be found on UNIX workstations. (The sad pathetic story of UNIX, which sucks, will be the topic of at least one other essay at some point, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. What a joke.) So that&amp;rsquo;s two reasons to have UNIX around a math department. Running an FTP server to distribute your papers, which are now completely electronically-based is a third, and for some the computational power of C programs is a fourth. In more recent days, web surfing is a must, and so is a web server. If students can&amp;rsquo;t get their homework and solutions and grades online these days (at least at Columbia), they start complaining (especially at Columbia, I bet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, so math departments have UNIX networks. Big deal. Well, you try running a UNIX system, even at home on your own PC or Mac, where you&amp;rsquo;re the only user. It&amp;rsquo;s hard. It&amp;rsquo;s hard mostly because UNIX sucks, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard nonetheless, and someone has to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s so hard, though, that to figure out how to do it is a &lt;strong&gt;full-time job&lt;/strong&gt;! (Man, does UNIX suck.) So, each department needs at least one individual whose responsibliity is to keep the system up and working smoothly, including the individual programs running on it like email clients and servers, or web clients and web servers. As people break the system (because it sucks and is impossible to figure out) this person has to deal with the offenders and fix the problems. It&amp;rsquo;s really a social job, requiring the monitoring of a large group of independent people. Sometimes technical announcements have to be made (&amp;ldquo;From now on, please don&amp;rsquo;t lpr a .dvi file on lw421&amp;rdquo;). Sometimes this person gets mad. And here is my point: what if this administrator gets so mad that they stop doing their job. What if they quit? Well, the entire operation of the department would be put in jeopardy. No one would get their email. At first they would be mad. &amp;ldquo;Hey, why is the damn email broken? For christ&amp;rsquo;s sake, do something!&amp;rdquo; Then they&amp;rsquo;d realize that the only person who knows how to fix it is gone. &amp;ldquo;Crap, Peter left.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;re powerless. They&amp;rsquo;d realize that they were entrusting a large and important element of their working life to one individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s too much power for one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need these technical programs working all the time. But they depend on one single individual person to do it. In some larger organizations, several people or a whole IS department may take care of it. But that means that those people can do something you can&amp;rsquo;t do yourself, even if you need it done now. It means that you have delegated responsibility for &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; machine and &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; email and &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; work to another. If it breaks, you &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong&gt; fix it, and they &lt;strong&gt;have to&lt;/strong&gt;. People won&amp;rsquo;t stand for that kind of balance of power for very long. How many secretaries out there have figured out how to fix their copiers because they can&amp;rsquo;t stand how long it takes for the real copy dude to show up, let alone do a decent job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies here. I think people will gradually devote more of their time to learning how more complex computer operations are managed, such as networking and email. I think the software will get easier to use also, like it does in every other segment of the computer industry. The knowledge will decentralize. It won&amp;rsquo;t be a specialization anymore. Everyone will know how it works, just like people tend to know a little about how their car works, or how their washing machine works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may ask, what about plumbing? I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to fix my plumbing, and I use that all the time. In fact, I use it more than email (speak for yourself!). I don&amp;rsquo;t know how the insides of any of my home gadgets work, like my stereo, my TV, my phone, or even my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good point. But computer software is somehow different, I think. So many people are using computer software these days, in so many incredibly complex ways, that something is very different about it. I think using software and email is like using the phone. It won&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal to restart your SMTP client or whatever, 5 years from now, because you just double-click this little icon, or select this menu entry. People are so comfortable with computers, that anyone who uses one today would be considered an expert four years ago. People know what GIFs are now, and how JPEGs can suck, so there&amp;rsquo;s a tradeoff. They know about 8-bit versus 24-bit color depth. They know how big 800x600 pixels is. They know how to defragment their hard drives. They know how SCSI works, and that it&amp;rsquo;s faster than IDE. They know that an en-dash and an em-dash are different typographically. They know what &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; means. They may even know what SGML stands for. Or the difference between a Postscript and a PDF file. These are extremely technical points, but some of us don&amp;rsquo;t see them that way anymore, because we literally work with them all the time. Computer technology is completely pervasive today, and will only get more so. Technical literacy is on the rise big time. And just in time for when your local guru gets fed up and quits. Maybe there won&amp;rsquo;t be IS departments in the future. Every working adult will know how to handle all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will probably know from age six.&lt;/p&gt;
